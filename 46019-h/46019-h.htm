<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pn p2">Many excellent things have been written about the
cities of the South, but little, comparatively speaking,
about the cities of the North. True, indeed, they have
not moulded kingdoms and shaped the culture of a
continent, but England, like Scandinavia, is not a
country city-built; she was formed by the dwellers
on the land. Yet the less prominent part that they
have played does not make our cities less noteworthy
than those of the South.</p>

<p>Few and peculiarly interesting are the cities of the
North. And, with the exception, perhaps, of St.
Petersburg, those spoken of in this book have all the
charm that comes because they were built by country-loving
folk, to whom deep woods and open fields were
lovelier than monumental streets and squares.</p>

<p>I shall not have written in vain if the perusal of this
small book leads any one to study larger works on the
Northlands, and particularly the matchless sagas,
many of them so skilfully Englished by the joint
labour of an Englishman and an Icelander, William
Morris and Eirîkr Magnússon. In them we may read
of all these ten towns, save that Copenhagen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
St. Petersburg have risen in Saga Lands after the
sagas were penned.</p>

<p>After accuracy I have striven hard, but if any
reader should detect any error I should be grateful to
have it pointed out for correction in a later edition.</p>

Heard ye the din of battle bray,</p>
<p class="ppi20">'Twixt Kiotvi rich, and Harald bold?<br />
Eastward sail the ships of war;<br />
The graven bucklers gleam afar,</p>
<p class="ppi20">And dragon heads adorn the prows of gold.</p>

And swords, and Celtic falchions bright,</p>
<p class="ppi20">And Western chiefs the vessels bring:<br />
Loudly roar the wolfish rout,<br />
And maddening Champions wildly shout,</p>

<p class="ppi20 p1">Firm in fight they proudly vie<br />
With him whose might will make them fly,</p>
<p class="ppi20">Of Eastmen kings the warlike head.<br />
Forth his gallant fleet he drew,<br />

<p class="ppi20">Where head-long cast they mourned the loss of light.</p>


<p class="pn p2">So does an Icelandic skald describe the most important
battle in the annals of the Norse.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Harald
Shock-head had exalted himself, and said "I will
be king" over the whole of Norway. He desired
to wed the daughter of the kinglet of Hordaland.
She was a maiden exceeding fair and withal somewhat
high-minded.</p>

<p>To Harald's messengers she answered in this wise:
"I will not waste my maidenhood for the taking to
husband of a king who has no more realm to rule
over than a few folks. Marvellous it seems to me
that there is no king minded to make Norway his
own, and be sole lord thereof in such wise as Gorm
of Denmark or Eric of Upsala have done."</p>

<p>The messengers came back in wrath and told the
king that Gyda (for so the maiden was called)
was witless and overbold, but Harald answered
that the maid had spoken nought of ill, and done
nought worthy of evil reward. Rather he bade her
much thank for her word; "For she has brought
to my mind that matter which it now seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
me wondrous I have not had in my mind heretofore."</p>

<p>And, moreover, he said: "This oath I make fast,
and swear before that god who made me and rules
over all things, that never more will I cut my hair
nor comb it, till I have gotten to me all Norway,
with the scat thereof and the dues, and all rule
thereover, or else will I die rather."</p>

<p>And so for ten winters his hair was neither cut nor
combed, but during all those days the kinglets were
being warred down, and at last, in 872, as monarch of
all Norway, Harald took a bath and let his hair be
combed. Jarl Rognvald sheared his locks and called
him Harald Fairhair; the name by which he is known
in history to-day.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Thus he wedded the fair Gyda, but unhappily he
also took to wife more other maidens than one may
count with ease. Their very numerous sons were
soon waxen riotous men in the land and were not at
one among themselves. The good work of their father
they came near to undoing.</p>

<p>For good work to Norway it very truly was: national
unity is a priceless thing. One king was better than a
score of kinglets from the nation's point of view.
But otherwise thought the jarls (or earls) and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
stoutest opponents of Harald embarked on their ships
and sailed away. Some turned their prows to the
northward and settled in the Faroes or Iceland, or on
the more distant American shore. These were, perhaps,
the more peaceably disposed; they found lands
waiting for settlement that became at once their own.
Their descendants are Norsemen to-day, and among
the most cultured of mankind. Others fared to the
British Isles or the Continent of Europe or to the
more distant Mediterranean Sea. These found lands
that were richer, but to be gained only at the point
of the sword. These set up powerful kingdoms, but
none of them are Norse to-day.</p>

<p>The classic sagas of Iceland have disappointingly
little to tell us about the Faroe Islands. There are
plenty of references to them indeed, but they are
exiguous and dull. The <i>Faereyinga Saga</i> is distinctly
less vigorous and vivid than the elder sagas of heroic
days. It was compiled in Iceland not long after
the beginning of the thirteenth century, but older
materials were used.</p>

<p>It commences with a somewhat scrappy description
of the first settlement of the islands. "There
was a man named Grim Camban. He first settled
the Faroes in the days of Harald Fairhair. For
before the king's overbearing many men fled in those
days. Some settled in the Faroes and began to dwell
there, and some sought to other waste lands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Gladly would we have more details of the first
settler in the islands with his Irish-sounding name,
but they are lost in the abyss of years. With great
probability, however, Professor York Powell, who
Englished the <i>Faereyinga Saga</i>, supposes that the first
place occupied was the present capital, the Harbour
of Thor. There at any rate was the chief seat of
the Thing or Moot for the Islands, certainly till the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>At Thorshavn, too, was played the first half of the
delightfully simple 2-Act drama which changed the
faith of the archipelago. The renowned King Olaf
Tryggvison of Norway (p. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>) had treated Sigmund
with high regard and caused him to trow in the faith
of the White Christ.</p>

<p>"When the spring was coming in, the king fell
on a day to talk with Sigmund, and said that he was
minded to send him out to the Faroes to christen the
folk that dwelt there. Sigmund said that he would
rather not do that errand, but at last said he would do
the king's will. Then the king made him lord over
all the islands, and gave him wise men to baptize the
folk and teach them the needful lore. Sigmund sailed
when he was bound, and sped well on his way. When
he came to the Faroes he summoned the franklins to
a Thing in Stromo,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and much folk came. And when
the Thing was set, Sigmund stood up and set forth his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
business at length, telling all that had happened since
he had gone eastward to Norway to see King Olaf
Tryggvison. Moreover, he said that the king had
laid all the island under his lordship, and most of the
franklins took this very well. Then Sigmund said on,
'I would likewise have you know that I have taken
another faith, and am become a Christian man. I
have also this errand and bidding from the king, to
turn all folk in the island to the true faith.' Thrond
answered this speech and said that it was right the
franklins should talk over this hard matter among
themselves. The franklins said this was well spoken.
Then they went to the other side of the Thing-field,
and Thrond told the franklins that the right thing
clearly was to refuse to fulfil this command, and he
brought things so far by his fair speeches that they
were all of one mind thereon. But when Sigmund
saw that all the folk had crowded over to Thrond's
side, so that there was none stood by him save his
own men who were christened, he said, 'Too much
might have I given Thrond to-day.' And now men
began to crowd back to where Sigmund was sitting;
they bore their weapons aloft and carried themselves
in no peaceful wise. Sigmund and his men sprang
up to meet them. Then spake Thrond, 'Let men
sit down and carry themselves more quietly. Now I
have this to tell thee, kinsman Sigmund; we franklins
are all of one mind on this errand thou hast done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
namely that we will by no means change our faith,
and we will set on here in the Thing and slay thee,
unless thou give it up and bind thyself fast never
more to carry this bidding to the islands.' And when
Sigmund saw that he could not then bring this matter
of the faith about, and was not strong enough to deal
with all the folk that was come together there by the
strong hand, it ended in his bidding himself to what
they wished with witnesses and hand-plight. And
with that the Thing broke up.</p>

<p>"Sigmund sat at home that winter, and was right
ill-pleased that the franklins had cowed him, although
he did not let his mind be known."</p>

<p>"One day in the spring, what time the races ran
faster and men thought no ship could live on the main
or between the islands, Sigmund set out from home
with thirty men and two ships, saying that he would
run the risk and carry out the king's errand or else
die. They ran for Ostero and made the island; they
got there at nightfall without being seen, made a
ring round the homestead at Gate, drove a trunk of
wood at the door of the house where Thrond slept,
and broke it down, then laid hands on Thrond and led
him out. Then said Sigmund, 'It happens now, as
it often does, Thrond, that things go by turns. Thou
didst cow me last harvest-tide, and gave me two hard
things to choose between; and now I will give thee
two very unlike things to choose between: the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
is good&mdash;that thou take the true faith and let thyself
be baptized, or else thou shalt be slain here on the
spot; and that is a bad choice for thee to make, for
thereby thou shalt swiftly lose thy wealth and earthly
bliss in this world, and get instead woe and the everlasting
torments of hell in the other world.' But
Thrond said, 'I will not fail my old friends.' Then
Sigmund sent a man to kill Thrond, and put a great
axe in his hand; but as he went up to Thrond with his
axe on high, Thrond looked at him and said, 'Strike
me not so quickly. I have something to say first.
Where is thy kinsman Sigmund?' 'Here am I,'
said he. 'Thou alone shalt settle between me and
thee, and I will take thy faith as thou wilt.' Then
said Thore, 'Hew at him, man.' But Sigmund said,
'He shall not be cut down this time.' 'It will be
thy bane and thy friends' as well if Thrond get off
to-day,' said Thore. But Sigmund said that he would
risk that. Then Thrond was baptized of the priest
and all his household. Sigmund made Thrond come
with him when he was baptized. And then he went
through all the Faroes and stayed not till the whole
people was christened."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>King Olaf, called the Thick in life and the Holy in
death&mdash;with whom we shall be much concerned later
on&mdash;also sought to make his influence felt in the
Faroe Islands. Thither he sent to look after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
royal interests Karl o' Mere, who had been a viking
and the greatest of lifters, but "was a man of great
kin, a man of mickle stir, a man of prowess and
doughty in many matters." Him King Olaf took
"into his peace, and thereafter into his good love, and
let array his journey in the best wise. Nigh twenty
men they were on board the ship. The king made
word to his friends in the Faroes, and sent Karl for
trust and troth to Leif, son of Ozur, and Gilli the
Speaker-at-law, and to that end he sent his tokens.
Karl fared forthwith when he was ready, and a fair
wind they had, and came to Faroe, and hove into
Thorshavn in Stream-isle. Then a Thing was summoned
there, and folk came thronging thereto.
Thither came Thrand o' Gate with a mickle flock, and
thereto came Leif and Gilli, and had with them a
multitude of people. Now when they set up their
tilts and dight them their booths there, they went to
see Karl o' Mere, and the greetings there were good."</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that one object the king
had at heart was to collect his scat (or taxes) from the
islands, and when the subject was mentioned to
Thrand he amiably replied that "it was due and
welcome that he should give that much furtherance
to the king's errand."</p>

<p>When the time came round for the next Thing,
Thrand duly fared to Thorshavn and, because he
had pains in the eyes and other ailments besides, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
let hang the inner part of his tent with black cloth so
that the daylight might be less dazzling. Here the
purse containing the scat was duly delivered to Leif,
who "bore it further out into the booth, where it
was light, and poured the silver down upon his shield,
and stirred it about with his hand, and said that Karl
should look at the silver.</p>

<p>"They looked on it for awhile, and Karl asked
Leif how the silver seemed to him. He answered:
'Methinks that every bad penny to be found in the
North isles is here come together.' Thrand heard this
and said: 'Seemeth the silver nought well to thee,
Leif?' 'Even so,' says he. Said Thrand: 'Forsooth,
those my kinsmen are no middling dastards,
whereas one may trust them in nought. I sent them
in the spring north into the islands to gather up the
scat, because last spring I was good for nothing
myself; but they will have taken bribes of the bonders
to take this false coin which is not deemed fit to pass.
Thou hadst better, Leif, look at this silver wherewith
my rents have been paid.'</p>

<p>"So Leif took back to him that silver, and took
from him another purse, and bore it to Karl, and they
ransacked it, and Karl asked what Leif thought of
this money. He said he deemed it bad, but not so
bad as that it might not be taken in payment for
debts carelessly bespoken,'but on behalf of the king
I will have nought of this money.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Thrand "bade Leif hand him that silver
back: 'And take thou here this purse which my
tenants have fetched me home last spring, and dim
of sight though I be, still, 'Self hand the safest
hand.'"</p>

<p>"Leif took the purse and once more bore it to Karl,
and they looked at the money, and Leif spoke:
'No need to look long at this silver; every penny
here is better than the other, and this money will we
have.'"</p>

<p>The payment of taxes has seldom proved the most
soothing thing for doubtful tempers. While the
money was being weighed there appeared on the
scene a man "with a cudgel in his hand and a slouch-hat
on his head, and a green cloak; barefoot, in linen
breeches strait-laced to the bone." There followed a
scrimmage, in the course of which Karl got an axe-hammer
in his brain, nor was his the only death.
"But it came never to pass that King Olaf might
avenge this on Thrand or his kinsmen, because of the
unpeace which now befell in Norway.... And hereby
leaves the tale to tell of the tidings which sprung out
of King Olaf's claiming scat of the Faroes. Yet
later on strifes arose in the Faroes out of the slaying
of Karl o'Mere, and the kinsmen of Thrand o' Gate
and Leif, the son of Ozur, had to do herein, and great
tales are told thereof."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>The haven of Thor is a little rocky bay; a small
island, called Nolsö, protects its broad mouth.
Streams trickle into it over the volcanic rocks, intersecting
the town and justifying the name of the island
upon whose shore it stands. One stream is fairly
large, the rest are very small. The well-kept gardens
are bright with flowers and stocked with currant
bushes; a few are shaded by plane trees of the most
diminutive size. The wooden houses, mostly Stockholm-tarred,
some painted different shades, rest on
rude foundations of boulders; some buildings are
wholly of rough stone. Most of the roofs are covered
with grass&mdash;amidst which wild flowers grow&mdash;so
green that they are not to be distinguished from the
hill-sides just behind, and the first impression is
almost that of a ruined, roofless town.</p>

<p class="b1">A few houses are creeper-covered: almost all have
fish hanging out to dry and the passer-by is more
conscious of their presence than of that of the flowers.
Through the grassy roofs rise chimneys which in many
cases are of wood. The main streets are wide and
breezy, the byways are but three feet broad; the
pavement for the most part is living rock. A mere
fishing village indeed is Thorshavn, but there is
much of the character of the capital of a little state.
The culture of Scandinavia is displayed in the existence
of a library, well used.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">The Amtmand, or Governor, dwells in a quite
imposing house of stone; school, church and Lagthinghuus
are merely framed of wood. Of the Mother
of Parliaments Cowper once wrote, and some are
making much the same remark to-day,</p>

<p class="ppn20">Where flails of oratory thresh the floor,<br />
That yields them chaff and dust and nothing more.</p>

<p class="p1">But of the legislature that meets in the Lagthinghuus
no man can say anything so rude. However barren
of other results the deliberations of the assembly
may be, the community is at least benefited by the
value of the hay that grows upon the roof. It may
be the sluggard that lets the grass grow under his
feet, but no stigma can attach to the man who lets
it grow over his head. Besides possessing this
venerable local Thing, the islanders send their own
representatives to the Rigsdag, or Diet, at Copenhagen,
for which qualified voters must have reached
their thirtieth year. The Danish dominions have
not yet followed Norway and Sweden in granting
votes to women, but this will shortly come to pass.</p>

<p>The mediæval bishop for the Faroes had his stool
at Kirkebö, on the same island as Thorshavn but a
few miles further south. There was a house of Benedictine
monks, the ruins of which still remain. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the haven named from Thor the church<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the White
Christ is conspicuous, though modern of date and
unbeautiful of form. An ancient coffin-slab, however,
is incised with an ornate and flowery cross,
that shows a mediæval structure occupied the site.
The tower vane bears the date 1788, pierced in
the Scandinavian way. The effect within is rather
quaint. On the altar two great candles stand;
hanging from the roof are a large ship-model and
some chandeliers of brass, one dated 1682, adorned
with metal flowers; on the walls a picture of the
Last Supper that was painted on wood in 1647, and
several monuments in timber and stone to the dead
who passed from earth two hundred years ago.</p>

<p>On a promontory overlooking the town and the
rocks covered with shells and pink and dark green
sea-weed, there frowns a picturesque old fort; more
interesting to the antiquary than formidable to the
soldier. What higher praise than that could any place
of strength deserve? The two lines of defence are
each formed of boulders and earth. Though Thorshavn
in the past has known unpeace, many an empire
has risen to high power or crumbled to decay since
these grass-grown ramparts were stained with human
gore.</p>

<p>The stony country round the town is partly enclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
by strange frail transparent dykes, which, though as
in Scotland mortarless, display surprisingly wide
openings between the stones. Hay grown on the
rocky soil is much the commonest crop; ragged
robin, white clover, and, in swampy parts, marsh
marigolds, diversify the grass. Men capped and
stockinged, women shawled, also tend the tiniest
patches of oats and potatoes: here and there peat is
cut. The older cottages are frequently half floored
above, half open to the ridge, and most conspicuous
still are the sooty rafters of which the sagas so often
tell. Some faint breath from the atmosphere that
filled such dwellings long ago is wafted to us by the
complaint of Cetil to his son in the <i>Vatzdaela Saga</i>,
that, when he was a boy, men yearned to do some
daring deed, "But now young men have become
stay-at-homes, sitting over the baking fires, and
stuffing their bellies with mead and ale, and all
manhood and hardihood is waning away." Gone
to museums are the ancient looms weighted with
stones from the beach, but old carved chests and
solid furniture of wood worked in the northern way
are still by no means rare.</p>

<p>Men of great mark, by no means few, have had
the Faroe Isles for home. In this remote and quiet
capital there was born in 1860 Dr. N. R. Finsen, one
of the great benefactors of mankind, widely known
in medical circles from his study of the laws of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
light-rays, and the foundation of the Medical Light
Institute at Copenhagen. A monument in the streets
of the Danish metropolis bears his name, and it is
possible that to the next generation he may be as
well known as he would have been to his own, had
he only invented some potent engine of destruction,
instead of mere antidotes to wasting disease.</p>

<p>A little like the Scottish highlands here and there,
with mountain tarn and trickling stream and rock
hill-side and distant sea, a little, yet not very like,
for the most striking feature of this delightful group
of islands is its lack of resemblance to any other part
of earth. Vast mountains rising from the very sea,
and never destitute of whitest clouds, fold upon fold
of country devoid of trees and yet so fertile and kept
so moist by shower and mist that the grass grows over
house-top as well as ground, the close proximity of
fjord and hay-field and fish and flowers, give a
combined impression so individual that the widest
wanderer will but faintly be reminded of any other
part of the world.</p>

<p>The surpassing stateliness of much of the coast
declines to be expressed in ink or paint. Even the
Naerofjord of Norway, most justly famed throughout
the earth, is distanced in wild and rugged grandeur
by some of the lonely channels among the north isles
of the group, restricted in extent though they be.
The largest steamer seems like a little toy between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
towering mountains that rise on either side, carved
into cliffs here and there, worn into caves now and
then. The mountain sides are marked by waterfalls,
like little silver threads. Wherever there is grass on
the steep volcanic rocks, appearing like insects, there
climb about white sheep and black; such gave the
archipelago its name&mdash;far, the Norse word for
sheep.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Everywhere hang white mists, clinging to
the summits of the hills or streaming away like
pennons in sharpest contrast with the coal-black
sea of the sagas.</p>

<p class="pn p2">A faint idea of Icelandic scenery may perhaps be
gained by taking a journey on the moon by the aid
of a good telescope. Nowhere else is to be found
the same weird impression of vastness and of
magnificent desolation!</p>

<p>Not infrequently, particularly in a land of hills,
do the works of man seem puny beside the works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
God, but as in Iceland nowhere else. Only rarely,
here and there, are signs of cultivation, and that is
on the tiniest scale. Wild stretches of jagged lava
and volcanic rock spread into space like "the ruins
of an elder world." The great rugged mountains,
capped by snow, and the numerous hot springs suggest
the eternal battle-ground of elements, and give to
the landscape a weird, almost unearthly effect.
As Gudbrand Thorlac (Bishop of Holar, quoted by
Hakluyt) expresses it: "There be in this Iland
mountaines lift up to the skies, whose tops being white
with perpetuall snowe, their roots boile with everlasting
fire." The prevailing colours, including every
shade of brown and yellow, are relieved only where
appears the deep blue-black of the sea; save that
here and there a tiny waterfall by stunted trees and
a carpet of wild flowers, such as heather or grass of
Parnassus, rather faintly suggest the glories of more
southern lands.</p>

<p>The Great Pyramid and the Chinese Wall themselves
would be lost, St. Peter's would appear a mere
pebble, amid those gigantic stretches of lonely mountain.
And during the very darkest days of early
mediæval times a small handful of men in these
remote solitudes were to play a part in history that
is perfectly unique, to endow humanity with something
it could ill afford to put away.</p>

<p>Here, on the dark winter nights of a region only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
just without the Arctic Circle, were written and
enjoyed those sagas that are true history and very
human, while nothing but dry chronicles were being
composed in all Europe besides. Far less we should
know of the early story of the British Isles and of
North America had the Icelanders been dumb.
Worthily appears the name of their Republic among
those of other famous Commonwealths of earth in
the hub of the universe, the State House at Boston,
Massachusetts!</p>

<p>Interest in Iceland and her sagas has been greatly
revived of recent years. In these days it seems
strange to read what P. H. Mallet (p. <a href="#Page_152">152</a>) wrote about
1755: "Such was the constitution of a republic,
which is at present quite forgotten in the North, and
utterly unknown through the rest of Europe even to
men of much reading, notwithstanding the great
number of poets and historians which that republic
produced."</p>

<p>The stories of the early settlers, as related in the
sagas, slightly recall the conditions that even to-day
exist in such places as Rhodesia and newly-opened
districts of the Western States. The details are as
different as they could well be, but there is something
of the same overflowing youthful vitality, the same
grim sort of humour and vigorous enjoyment of life.
This tale, for instance, from the <i>Liosvetninga Saga</i>,
shows a rather indirect and possibly somewhat modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
method of leading up to an extremely simple point:
"When the table was set there Ufey put his fist
on the board, and spake, 'How big dost think that
fist is, Gudmund?' He spake, 'Very big!' Ufey
spake, 'Thou wouldst think that there would be
strength in it.' Gudmund spake, 'Indeed I would.'
Ufey answers, 'A heavy blow thou wouldst think it
would give?' Gudmund spake, 'Mighty heavy.'
Ufey spake, 'What harm wouldst think it would
do?' Gudmund spake, 'Breaking of bones or death.'
Ufey spake, 'How wouldst like that way of death?'
Gudmund spake, 'Very ill, and I should not wish it
to happen to me.' Ufey spake, 'Then do not thou
sit in my seat.'"</p>

<p>The settlement of Iceland was part of the happy
movement that first carried Norsemen to the Faroe
Islands and far beyond. There was a man named
Gard-here, a Swede, and he journeyed to Sodor, or
the Southern Islands<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> on the very common quest
of getting in the inheritance of his wife's father, who
had died. A gale broke his moorings. He was
driven westward into the sea, and the eventual result
was that he reached the island with which we are
concerned. He praised the land much, and desired
that it should be called by his own name.</p>

<p>But <i>he</i> did not discover the island. That glory
belongs to dreamy mystics of the ancient Irish Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in the days when her rays lit up the whole of Western
Europe, and her missionaries went out into all
lands.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Where he heard no other sound than the
thud of the storm waves on the lonely rocks, and the
shrill cry of the sea-gulls, quite alone with his God,
there the Celtic monk could best say his prayers.
And the <i>Libellus Islandorum</i> expressly says of the first
days of settlement: "There were then here Christian
men, whom the Northmen call 'papa.' But soon
they went away because they could not dwell with
pagan hordes, and they left behind them Irish books
and bells and crooks." A little cross of theirs is in
the Museum at Reykjavik to-day.</p>

<p>Again there were certain men who needed to
journey out of Norway to the Faroes, some say that
Naddodh was of their number, and they also were
driven to the same country, which they named
Snowland. They walked up a high mountain in the
East-friths, and looked far and wide to see if they
could discover any smoke or other token of the presence
of mankind, but they saw none. They went
back to the Faroes at harvest-time and they praised
the new country very much.</p>

<p>The third party of Norsemen that reached Iceland
had decorously made a great sacrifice before setting
forth, and three ravens had been hallowed. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Faroe Islands, Floki, their leader, got his daughter
very satisfactorily married, and then he sailed out
into the sea and let loose the three ravens. The first
feebly flew to the bows of the vessel; the second
with little more adventure soared into the air and
then came back to the ship; but the third flew forth
from the bows and led the way to the island. And
when they sailed past Reek-ness, or Smoky Cape, and
entered the great mountain-walled fjord, Faxe said,
"This must be a big country which we have found;
here are great rivers." And, though his surmise as
to the rivers was mistaken, the inlet received his
name; as Faxefjoth men know it to this day. The
whole frith was full of fish, including seals and whales,
and the party became so absorbed in catching them
that they imprudently took no heed to make hay&mdash;with
the result that they lost all their stock in the
winter. As to the climate there were many different
views, but Thorwolf said that butter dripped out of
every blade of grass in the country that they had
found. Wherefore he was called Thorwolf Butter.</p>

<p>It was nevertheless so cold that the party originated
the unfortunate designation of Iceland, a name
that has probably done more than anything else to
spread through the world undoubtedly exaggerated
notions as to the coldness of the island. Sometimes
for weeks together Reykjavik has been warmer than
London. The famous Icelandic explorer, Eric the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Red, seems to have realised that a mistake had been
made, and with much discretion he gave another
land "a name, and called it Greenland, and said that
men would be ready to go thither if the land had a
good name."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The Icelanders are as sensitive as the Canadians
about the climate of their country, and as early as the
sixteenth century we find the Bishop of Holar, already
mentioned (p. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>), whose observations are quoted by
Hakluyt, growling thus about one whose strictures on
the island did not however stop with criticisms of the
climate. "There came to light about the yeare of
Christ 1561, a very deformed impe, begotten by a
certain Pedlar of Germany; namely, a booke of
German rimes, of al that ever were read the most
filthy and most slanderous against the nation of
Island. Neither did it suffice the base printer once
to send abroad that base brat, but he must publish
it also thrise or foure times over; that he might
thereby, what lay in him, more deepely disgrace our
innocent nation among the Germans, and Danes,
and other neighbour countries, with shamefull, and
everlasting ignomine. So great was the malice of
this printer, and his desire so greedy to get lucre, by
a thing unlawfull. And this he did without controlment,
even in that citie, which these many yeares
hath trafficked with Island to the great gaine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
commodity of the citizens. His name is Ioachimus
Leo, a man worthy to become lion's foode."</p>

<p>As late as 1846 "Sylvanus" (p. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>) wrote, "Iceland,
a dreary, storm-beaten isle, nearly deprived of all
communication with its fatherland. It is the abode
of all but ceaseless winter, in which the sun, rarely
for more than a few months out of the twelve, is
ever seen."</p>

<p>It is possible to suffer very much from heat in
Iceland, but there seems to be good ground for believing
that the climate has changed for the severer in
the course of a thousand years. Forests are frequently
mentioned in the earlier sagas&mdash;the <i>Libellus
Islandorum</i> expressly says that in the first days of
settlement the country "was grown with wood
between fell and foreshore." But to-day there is
nothing much bigger than a Japanese dwarf tree.</p>

<p>The first permanent settler was Ingwolf Arnerson
(or Erneson) and he was told to go thither by an
oracle while he sacrificed. And at that time Harald
of the Fairhair had for twelve years been king in
Norway, and since the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus
Christ 874 winters had passed away. He sailed to
Iceland with Heor-leif, his sworn brother and the
husband of his sister; a man who refused to sacrifice.
They kept company till they saw Iceland and then
they parted. And as soon as Ingwolf noticed the
land he pitched his porch-pillars overboard to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
an omen. For it was the pious custom of those days
to let the site for a new settlement be fixed, not by
the caprice of man, but by the decision of the gods,
who made it known by causing the currents of ocean
to cast up the porch-pillars on the shore where they
would have the dwelling to be.</p>

<p>Before their emigration to Iceland Leif and Ingwolf
had made a foray in Ireland. There they had gained
riches and thralls, and Leif was called Heor, or Sword,
from an encounter with an Irishman, from whom he
gained such a weapon. Driven westward off the
land, Leif and his men ran short of water, and the
thralls, with the readiness that ever marks their race,
took to the plan of kneading meal and butter together,
and they declared that this was a thirst-slake. But
as soon as it was ready there fell a great rain and
water was caught in the awnings.</p>

<p>Eventually they reached land in safety, and there
was only one ox, so the thralls had to drag the plow.
And they plotted together to kill the ox, and to say
that a bear had devoured it; then while Leif and his
Norsemen were seeking to punish the non-existent
bear, and were scattered through the shaw, the thralls
should slay every one his man, and so should murder
them all. And everything fell out just as the Irish
had plotted.</p>

<p>The dead body of Heor-leif was found by Ingwolf's
thralls, who had been sent to search for the porch-pillars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and when they told their master he was very
angry. And when he saw his brother dead he said,
"It was a pitiful death for a brave man that thralls
should slay him, but I see how it goes with those
who will never perform sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Then Ingwolf went up to the headland and saw
islands lying in the sea to the south-west. It came
into his mind that the thralls must have run away
thither, for the boat had disappeared. So he and his
men went to seek the thralls, and found them there
at a place called Eith (the Tarbet) in the islands.
They were sitting at their meat when Ingwolf fell
upon them. They became fearful, and every man
of them ran off his own way. Ingwolf slew them
all. The place is called Duf-thac's Scaur, where he
lost his life. Many of them leaped over the rock,
which was afterwards called by their name. The
islands were afterwards called the Westmen Isles
whereon they were slain, for they were Westmen"
(or Irish).</p>

<p>Heimaey (or Home Isle), the largest of these
Westmen Isles, consists of two great jagged masses
of igneous rock, presenting wild cliffs to the ocean
and a wild fretted outline to the sky. Between
the two mountains is a rolling stretch of grass-land,
and upon it stands the scattered little town of Kaupstadr.
The cliffs are covered with sea-birds' nests,
most of them filthy fulmars. And some of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
islands of the group, among which modern cruising
steamers thread their way, are sea-worn into caves
and caverns by the much contorted rocks along the
shore.</p>

<p>At last, in the third winter, Ingwolf's thralls,
Weevil and Carle, found the porch-pillars, and at the
spot where they came to land he made for himself
a homestead. He dwelt in Reek-wick, and the <i>Land-nama-bok</i>,
or Icelandic <i>Domesday</i>, from which nearly
all the above facts are taken,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> says that the pillars are
still to be seen in his fire-house, or temple.</p>

<p>In the <i>Eyrbyggja Saga</i> we read of the building of
another temple that stood on the north side of Faxefjoth.
Somewhat similar, no doubt, was the shrine
that incorporated the porch-pillars at Reykjavik.
"There he let build a temple, and a mighty house
it was. There was a door in the side-wall, and nearer
to one end thereof. Within the door stood the porch-pillars
and nails were therein; they were called the
Gods' nails. There within was a great frith-place.
But of the inmost house was there another house, of
the fashion whereof now is the quire of a church,
and there stood a stall in the midst of the floor in the
fashion of an altar, and thereon lay a ring without
a join that weighed twenty ounces, and on that must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
men swear all oaths; and that ring must the chief
have on his arm at all man-motes."</p>

<p>A gold ring that Olaf Tryggvison took from the
Temple of Lade (p. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>), and presented to a lady whom
he admired, turned out to be only plated copper,
and much trouble resulted from that gift. The gods
had in all probability never discovered the fraud, for,
like the Chinese to-day, the pagan Norse had a most
mean opinion of the intelligence of the objects of
their worship (p. <a href="#Page_106">106</a>). Some of the temples of Iceland
were of considerable dimensions: in the <i>Vatzdaela
Saga</i> we read of one at Thordisholt a hundred feet
in length.</p>

<p>Ingwolf, the founder of Reykjavik, was the most
famous of all the fathers of Iceland, for he came to a
desolate country, and was the first to build a house
and to cultivate the ground. His son "was Thorstan,
who let set the Thing at Keel-ness, before the
Allthing was established. His son was Thor-kell
Moon, the Law-speaker, who was one of the best
conversation of any heathen men in Iceland, of those
whom men have records of. He had himself carried
out into the rays of the sun in his death-sickness,
and commended himself to that God which had made
the sun. Moreover, he had lived as cleanly as those
Christian men who were of the best conversation or
way of life." (<i>Landnama-bok.</i>)</p>

<p>A fair broad bay, an arm of the Faxefjoth, rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
islands rising from the water and low hills all around,
the heights of Esja straight in front of the ship that
sails in, was the site chosen by the pagan gods.
The city of Reykjavik stands on low hills at whose
foot the porch-pillars were found. At the head of
the little reeking bay is the white steam of the hot
springs; away to the north, just visible across the
choppy waves of Faxefjoth, towers, four thousand
seven hundred feet above the sea, the huge volcanic
mass of Snaefells Jökull.</p>

<p>Thus Reykjavik, the present capital of Iceland,
bordered landward by a little lake, is more than a
thousand years old, yet it does not look fifteen!
No new settlement in the American West has a rawer
or more recent appearance. The building materials
are wood, brick, cement, felt and galvanized iron.
There are a few fair gardens with very stunted trees,
and in the rough grass square is a metal statue to
Thorwaldsen (p. <a href="#Page_138">138</a>). For ugly commonplaceness
the broad and dusty streets are hardly rivalled even
on the North American continent, and that is saying
a good deal. Yet the glorious views of wild mountain
and ever-changing sea, with air as fresh and pure as
in mid-ocean, make it attractive in spite of all.</p>

<p>The Norse settlement of the island, having prosperously
begun on the grassy plains at the edge of
which the city stands, soon spread all round the shore.
At wide intervals were built, or dug, the half underground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
turf-covered dwellings where men sat under
their smoky rafters by the fire, drinking wine or mead,
telling or hearing the saga tales. Old buildings that
still remain, including a few in the vicinity of Reykjavik,
give a fair idea of what these primitive dwellings
were like; sometimes they were partly excavated in
the side of a hill. Their interiors are much more
cosy and homelike than would be suspected from
their desolate-looking outsides. Hangings round the
walls must have greatly improved the appearance as
a rule, though the <i>Laxdaela Saga</i> says that the hall
which Thurid Olaf built in Herd-holt, whose sides and
roof were lined with noble histories carved on wainscotting,
looked better when the hangings were down.
Each large householder was chief and priest, lord of
all within sight of his dwelling.</p>

<p>The same (<i>Laxdaela</i>) saga describes one of them,
in fact the husband of this same Olaf's daughter.
"Garmund was generally a reserved man, and surly
to most folks, and he was always dressed the same;
he used to wear a red-scarlet kirtle and a grey cloak
over it, and a bear-skin hood on his head, a sword in
his hand that was a great and good weapon with
hilt of walrus-tooth, and there was no silver inlaid
on it, but the blade was sharp and no rust to be
found on it. This sword he called Leg-biter, and
he never let it pass out of his hand." This man
contrived to win Thurid, the daughter of Olaf, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
by "giving no small sum of money" to her mamma.
As not infrequently happens in such cases, husband
and wife "did not get on very well, and this was
felt by both of them." So Garmund sailed away from
Iceland, and, to the great displeasure of his wife and
mother-in-law, he left no chattels behind him. However
Olaf's daughter pursued and, finding her husband
asleep in his vessel, she took away the sword Leg-biter
and left the baby in its place! As soon as the disgusted
father awoke from its crying and discovered
the unwelcome exchange, he sent a boat in pursuit of
wife and sword. Thurid had, however, foreseen that
man&oelig;uvre and the boat, being riddled with holes,
had in haste to put back to the ship. "Then Garmund
called to Thurid and bade her turn back and
give him the sword Leg-biter, and take the girl back,
'and as much money or chattels with her as thou
wilt.' Thurid says, 'Dost think it better to get
back the sword or not?' Garmund answered her,
'I would sooner lose great monies than lose the sword.'
She spake, 'Then thou shalt never get it; thou hast
in many ways treated me unjustly, and we will now
part.'"</p>

<p>Even less careful of his personal appearance than
Garmund must have been Anlaf of Black-fen, whose
deeds are recorded in the <i>Havardz Saga</i> (II., 1). Men
say that he had bear's warmth, for "there never was
frost or cold so great that Anlaf would not go about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in no more clothes than his breeches and a shirt
tucked into the breeches. And he never went abroad
off the farm with more clothes on him than these."
He was, however, a good man, and somewhat before
midwinter he walked over the hill pasture and all
over the fell seeking men's sheep, and he found many
and drove them home, and brought every man his
own, so that every one wished him well.</p>

<p>Iceland is perhaps the least mixed nation to be
found on the surface of the globe. Among the
fathers of her settlement there were indeed a few of
other than Norse blood, particularly ubiquitous
Irish, some of whom were men very well thought of,
but all except a few individuals here and there were
of pure Scandinavian stock. The <i>Landnama-bok</i>
expressly tells us: "Men of knowledge say that the
country was wholly settled and taken up in sixty
winters, so that it hath never after been settled
any more."</p>

<p>As the community grew older it became apparent
that something more than local chiefs and Things
were imperatively needed if any sort of peace was to
be preserved and some kind of order to be established.
And thus there was called into being in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 930 the
most famous parliament of the North&mdash;the Allthing,
that assembled every year under the clear sky, by
the banks of a little stream where the horizon was
formed by the wild rocky hills of Thingvellir. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
all over the island men came for practically every
purpose for which human beings can gainfully meet.
Laws were made and declared, law cases were decided;
tales were recited and much was bought and sold.
But the only official of the Republic was the Speaker
of the Law, the jurisdiction was purely moral.
Administrative machinery, civil service, navy or
army there were none. He who refused to obey
could but be outlawed.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>No doubt this essentially Teutonic reform brought
vast improvement on the lawless violence of earlier
days, but the respect entertained for law still left very
much to be desired. The famous <i>Saga of the Burnt
Njal</i> gives a truly Homeric account of proceedings at
the Allthing itself.</p>

<p>Flosi and certain others who were on trial for
arson and manslaughter were on the point of getting
off by the kind of legal quibble in which Dickens was
interested so much. Gizur, one of the plaintiffs,
said, "What counsel shall we now take, kinsman
Asgrim?" Then Asgrim said, "Now will we send
a man to my son Thorhall, and know what counsel
he will give us."</p>

<p>"Now the messenger comes to Thorhall, Asgrim's
son, and tells him how things stood, and how Mord
Volgard's son and his friends would all be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
outlaws, and the suits for manslaughter be brought
to nought.</p>

<p>"But when he heard that, he was so shocked at it
that he could not utter a word. He jumped up then
from his bed, and clutched with both hands his spear,
Skarphedinn's gift, and drove it through his foot....
Now he went out of the booth unhalting and walked
so hard that the messenger could not keep up with
him, and so he goes until he came to the Fifth Court.
There he met Grim the Red, Flosi's kinsman, and as
soon as they were met, Thorhall thrust at him with
the spear, and smote him on the shield and clove it
in twain, but the spear passed right through him,
so that the point came out between his shoulders.
Then there was a mighty cry all over the host, and
then they shouted their war-cries.</p>

<p>"Flosi and his friends then turned against their
foes, and both sides egged on their men fast.</p>

<p>"Kari Solmund's son turned now thither where
Arni (Kol's son) and Hallbjorn the Strong were in
front, and as soon as ever Hallbjorn saw Kari, he made
a blow at him, and aimed at his leg, but Kari leaped
up into the air, and Hallbjorn missed him. Kari
turned on Arni (Kol's son) and cut at him, and smote
him on the shoulder, and cut asunder the shoulder
blade and collar bone, and the blow went right down
into his breast, and Arni (Kol's son) fell down dead at
once to earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"After that he hewed at Hallbjorn and caught him
on the shield, and the blow passed through the shield,
and so down and cut off his great toe. Holmstein
hurled a spear at Kari, but he caught it in the air,
and sent it back, and it was a man's death in Flosi's
band....</p>

<p>"Then there was a little lull in the battle, and
Snorri the priest came up with his band, and Skapti
was there in his company, and they ran in between
them, and so they could not get at one another to
fight.... So a truce was set, and was to be kept
throughout the Thing, and then the bodies were laid
out and borne to the church, and the wounds of those
men were bound up who were hurt."</p>

<p>The day after men went to the Hill of Laws. A
skald opportunely sang some verses with the result
that now men burst out in great fits of laughter.
And eventually "in this way the atonement came
about, and then hands were shaken on it, and twelve
men were to utter the award, and Snorri the priest
was the chief man in this award, and others with
him. Then the manslaughters were set off the one
against the other, and those men who were over and
above were paid for in fines. They also made an
award in the suit about the Burning."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Allthing still meets, but no longer amid
mountain wilds. A very substantial stone structure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
two storeys and an attic high, faces the square at
Reykjavik; it bears date 1881. Below is a library;
above the chamber, from a gallery in the attic, the
public may look on. It is impossible to visit this
humble structure without emotion, for it is the seat
of one of the ancientest moots upon the earth. Had
it only a continuous history from its first institution
it would be older by, at any rate, a century or two
than the very Mother of Parliaments, for the French-named
body that sits at St. Stephen's can hardly
claim historic continuity with the Saxon Witanagemot.
But the well-fitted Althinghuus is an unromantic
substitute for the vast and desolate wildness
of the Thingvellir. It is with a shock, too, that one
notices on the walls great pictures of Egypt and of
Greece. Are not Ellidaar and Hvita, salmon rivers
of Iceland, to this assembly at any rate better than
all the waters of Nile and Cephissus?<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The Cathedral of Reykjavik, next to the Althinghuus,
is a small whitewashed structure with saddle
roof tower, whose vane is dated 1847. It is entirely
destitute of the slightest interest, save for the lovely
font by Thorwaldsen (p. <a href="#Page_138">138</a>), a cube of white marble.
Round the top is a garland of flowers to support
the metal bowl; on the four sides are bas-reliefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
representing the Baptism of Christ, a mother and her
children, cherubs, and Christ blessing the children.
The Bishop, or Lutheran superintendent, has charge
of the whole island, which in the middle ages formed
two dioceses.</p>

<p>The Christianising of Iceland was a less violent
process than that of the other northern lands. The
building of the earliest church was owing to the gentle
influence of the great Scottish apostle of Ireland.
"Aur-lyg was the name of a son of Hrapp, the son
of Beorn Buna. He was in fosterage with Bishop
Patrec, the saint in the Southreys. A yearning came
upon him to go to Iceland, and prayed Bishop
Patrec that he would give him an outfit. The bishop
gave him timber for a church and asked him to take
it with him, and a <i>plenarium</i>, and an iron church-bell,
and a gold penny, and consecrated earth to lay
under the corner-posts instead of hallowing the
church, and prelates to dedicate the church to Columcella."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
And the church was built at Esia-rock,
looking out over the ocean. Close by in the sea-weed
the iron bell had been found, for it was cast into the
sea that, like the heathen porch-pillars, it might
point out the exact site that was the best.</p>

<p>The passing from the old faith to the new was
on the whole remarkably destitute of bigotry. One,
Helge, for example, "put his trust in Christ, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
named his homestead after him, but yet would he
pray to Thor on sea voyage and in hard stress, and
in all those things that he deemed really of most
account."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> While the <i>Landnama-bok</i> itself ends
with the remark: "Some held their Christendom
well till their death-day, but it did not often go on in
the family, because that of their sons, some reared
temples and sacrificed, and the land was heathen
nearly a hundred and twenty winters."</p>

<p>Then at a notable Allthing, about the year 1000,
one Thor-gar spoke to the people at the Rock of the
Laws. He told them a story about two kings who
formerly ruled in Norway and Denmark respectively.
"They had long kept up strife between them, till at
last the people of both countries took the matter into
their own hands, and made peace between them,
although they themselves did not wish it; but this
plan was so successful that the kings after a few
winters' space were sending gifts to each other, and
their friendship endured as long as they both did
live. 'And this seems to me the best not to let them
have their will that are most out and out on each side,
but let us so umpire the matter between them that
each side may gain somewhat of his case, but let us
all have one law and one faith. For this saying shall
be proved true, <i>If the Constitution be broken the peace
will be broken</i>.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thor-gar ended his speech in such a way that
each side agreed to hold those laws which he should
think best to declare.</p>

<p>"This was the declaration of Thor-gar, that all
men in Iceland should be baptized and believe in one
God, but as to the exposure of children, and the eating
of horse-flesh, the old law should hold; men might
sacrifice in secret if they would, but should fall under
the lesser outlawry if witnesses came forward against
them. This heathendom was taken away some years
later."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The final establishment of the faith was chiefly
owing to Bishop Gizor, who was, we are told, "better
beloved by all the people of the land than any other
man whom we know to have been on the land."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Such, indeed, was the devotion men felt for him, so
much did they appreciate his speeches, that the
Icelanders voluntarily agreed to a complete valuation
of all that they possessed in order that they might
have the privilege of paying tithes! Greater proof
of love than that no people ever showed! It would
stagger humanity indeed were anything of the sort
to be recorded to-day. Gizor it was who fixed the
seat of the Bishopric at Skalholt, for before it was
nowhere; he, too, set up the northern Bishop's stool
at Holar, giving more than the fourth part of his
income to endow it. This Gizor was surnamed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
White, and he kept such peace in the land that there
were no great feuds between the chiefs, and the carrying
of arms was almost laid aside. And he sent his
son Islaf to school in Saxland; he also became
a Bishop and took to wife Dalla, the daughter of
Thorwald.</p>

<p>So the faith in Iceland grew, not by bigotry but
by conciliation, and men were apt to prefer prime-signing
to baptism, for so could they have full intercourse
with Christian men and with heathen too,
and they could hold to the faith of their liking.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
But good arguments had a very-powerful effect,
and "this made men very eager in church-building,
which was promised by the clergy, that a man should
have room in the Kingdom of Heaven for as many as
could stand in the church that he had built."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Things being thus comfortably and happily settled
by the Icelanders, it was not to be expected that
the sledge-hammer methods of the mainland would
find much favour among them. St. Olaf (p. <a href="#Page_79">79</a>) sent
a priest, one Thangbrand, to hasten the triumph of
the faith in Iceland, but he soon made that cool
country a great deal too hot to hold him. And, as
the <i>Cristne Saga</i> puts it: "At that very time Thangbrand
the priest came to the king from Iceland, and
told him what enmity men had shown him there,
and said there was no hope of Christendom being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
received there. Then the king was so angry that
he had many of the Icelanders taken prisoners and
set in irons. Some he ordered to be slain, and some
maimed, and some were plundered, for he said that
he would pay them for the unworthy way their fathers
had received his message in Iceland. But Sholto
and Gizor spoke for them, saying that the king had
promised that no man should have done such ill,
but that he would give them his peace if they would
be baptized.... Moreover Gizor said that he
thought there was hope that Christendom would
succeed in Iceland if it were wisely forwarded. 'But
Thangbrand hath carried himself there, as he did
here, rather lawlessly in slaying certain men there,
and men thought it hard to brook such behaviour
in a stranger.'"</p>

<p class="b1">Longfellow (<i>The Saga of King Olaf</i>) sums up this
troublesome missionary in the following verse:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppi20">He was quarrelsome and loud,<br />
And impatient of control,</p>
<p class="ppi20">Boisterous in the market crowd,<br />
Boisterous at the wassail-bowl,</p>
<p class="ppn25">Everywhere<br />
Would drink and swear,</p>
<p class="ppi20">Swaggering Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.</p>

<p class="p1">So firm a hold did Christianity take on the land
that the sagas of early Christian days are largely
concerned with bishops' lives. The Church was as
powerful as in Italy, and the two prelates were much
honoured in the land. Thus we read in the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
called <i>Hungrvaca</i>, or <i>Hunger-Waker</i>, because many
uninformed men, wise though they be, that have
gone through it have wished to know much more
concerning those notable persons of whom it speaks.
"Bishop Cetil was now well seventy years of age;
he went to the Allthing and commended himself to
the prayers of all the clerks in the synod of priests.
And then Bishop Magnus asked him to come home
with him to Skalholt to keep the dedication feast
of the church and a bridal that was to be there. The
feast was so very splendid that it was a pattern after
in Iceland; there was much mead mixed, and all
other stores of the best that might be. But the
Friday evening both bishops went to bathe at Bathridge
after supper. And then it came to pass that
Bishop Cetil died there, and men thought this great
news (July 6, 1145). There was great grief at this
feast among many of the guests till the bishop was
buried and service done for him. But by the comforting
speeches of Bishop Magnus and the noble
drink that was provided, men got their sorrow the
sooner out of mind than they would otherwise have
done."</p>

<p>The bathing of the bishops was in Iceland by no
means exceptional. While in the rest of Europe
personal cleanliness was inconspicuous between the
destruction of the buildings of Rome and comparatively
recent days, in Iceland, even during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
tenth century, men could not get on without washing.
One householder is specially distinguished in the
<i>Landnama-bok</i> as Leot the Unwashed. Thus the
<i>Eyrbyggja Saga</i> describes a bath: "Stir let build a
hot bath at his house at Lava, and it was dug down in
the ground, and there was a window over the furnace,
so that it might be fed from without, and wondrous
hot was that place." Many such are mentioned
in the sagas, and one of the few mediæval ruins in
Iceland is that of the bath-house of Snorri Sturluson,
author of the <i>Heimskringla</i>, one who adorned history
by his writings, but not by his actions; for the discreditable
collapse of the Republic and the annexation
of Iceland to Norway was largely owing to him.
On his own estate and by his own son-in-law he was
murdered in 1241.</p>

<p>Two Icelandic bishops were placed among the Saints.
Bishop Thorlak of Skalholt "never spoke a word that
did not tend to some good purpose when he was
asked anything. He was so wary of his words that
he never blamed the weather as many do, or any of
those things that are not blameworthy, but which
he perceived went according to God's will. He did
not look forward to any day above the rest." And
most deservedly he was called that precious friend of
God, the Beam and Gem of Saints, both in Iceland
and other lands.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>A still greater reputation was, however, gained by
the other Icelandic saint, the holy bishop, John of
Holar, widely famed for the beauty of his voice. His
peculiar holiness very early in his life attracted the
attention of the devout. "When John was yet a
child his father and mother broke up housekeeping
and went abroad together. They came to Denmark
and went to King Swein, and the king received
them worshipfully, and Thorgerd (John's mother)
was made to sit by the queen herself, the mother of
King Swein. Thorgerd had her son, the holy John,
at the table with her, and when many kinds of
precious dainties with good drink came to the king's
table, then it happened with the boy John, as is ever
the way with children, that he stretched out his
hands to the things he wished to have. But his
mother would have chidden him, and smote his hands.
But when Queen Estrith saw this, she spake to
Thorgerd, 'Not so, not so, Thorgerd mine; do not
strike those hands, for they are bishop's hands!"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>John not only survived this spoiling, but fulfilled
the prophecy of the kindly queen. In due course,
bearing a letter from Bishop Gizor, he sailed to Denmark
for his consecration; "the Archbishop was at
church at evensong, and when John, the holy bishop-elect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
got to the church (presumably the Cathedral
at Lund), evensong was well-nigh over. He took
his place outside the quire, and began to sing evensong
with his clerks. The Archbishop had forbidden all
his clerks, old and young alike, to look out of the
quire while the hours were being sung, and he set a
penalty to be taken if his command were broken.
But as soon as the Archbishop heard the chanting
of the holy John, he looked out down the church,
trying to see who the man was that had such a voice.
But when evensong was over, the Archbishop's
clerks said to him, 'How now, my lord bishop, have
ye not yourself broken the rules ye made?' The
Archbishop answered, 'I confess that it is true as
ye say, but yet I have not done it for nought, for a
voice was borne into my ears such as I have never
heard before, and it may rather be likened to the
voice of an angel than of a man.'"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The Primate perceived that his very dear brother
had all the qualities desirable in a bishop, and so favourable
was the impression made that the canonical
difficulty to the consecration&mdash;that John had been
twice married&mdash;was surmounted with little trouble.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Well did the new bishop regulate the affairs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
church on his arrival at Holar, where he rebuilt the
Cathedral, and at the bishopstead, west of the church
door, set up a school. A master he chose from Gothland
and he paid him a great wage, both to teach
the priestlings and to give such support to holy
Christendom along with the bishop himself as he
could manage in his teachings and addresses. By
this time the days of transition in Iceland were
over, and John felt strong enough not only to destroy
the material relics of paganism, but also to anticipate
George Fox in objecting to pagan names for
the days of the week. "He also forbade all omens,
which the men of old had been wont to take from
the coming of the moon and observance of days, and
dedicating days to heathen men or gods&mdash;as it is
when they are called Tew's day, Woden's day, or
Thor's, and so of all the week-days; but he bade
men to keep the reckoning which the holy fathers
have set in the Scriptures, and call them the Second
Day of the week, and the Third Day, and so on&mdash;and
all other things beside, which he thought sprung
from ill roots."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> At last, in 1121, on April 23, he
departed out of this world into everlasting bliss.</p>

<p>As might perhaps be expected, by far the most
interesting object in Reykjavik is the National
Museum, into which is gathered, Scandinavian fashion,
much choice carved work from many an Icelandic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
church. For their inability to raise great fabrics
like those of southern lands, the disciples of the
White Christ in Iceland, much as in Ireland, resolved
as far as possible to atone by wealth of detail. Here
accordingly are quaint or beautiful works of art
whose composition beguiled many a long winter
night of old. Even Mallet (p. <a href="#Page_151">151</a>) most patronisingly
remarks: "Nor is this sculpture so bad as might
be expected." The sagas here and there refer to the
use of timber from the Icelandic forests for purposes
of building, but soft drift-wood is by far the commonest
material used for carving figures of saints,
many of which are extremely crude and some grotesque.
The ornate "Kirkjustodir" are rather like
the totem poles of North American Indians. Many
things there are of post-Reformation date, as pulpits,
bas-reliefs and fonts. Runic inscriptions survive
into the eighteenth century. The finest feature is
the magnificent retable in alabaster and wood, representing
scenes from the Passion, that came from
Holar Cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Carving of similar kind, though
much earlier in date, for Skalholt Cathedral is described
in the <i>Pols Saga</i>.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Margaret was the most
cunning carver of all folk in Iceland, and she was
surnamed the Skilful. "Bishop Paul had put in
hand, and had her begin a tabula for the altar before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
he died, and had meant to spend on it much money,
both gold and silver, and Margaret carved it most
nobly out of tusk-ivory, and this would have been
the greatest jewel or masterpiece if, according to his
plan, both Thorstan the shrine-maker and Margaret
had wrought it out with their craft. But his death
was a big black blow, and such things had to be put
off for the sake of many other things that had to be
done."</p>

<p>Some objects illustrate things other than ecclesiastical,
but, comparatively speaking, they are few.
Among them are old Icelandic chair-saddles with huge
and unwieldy stirrups, and guns of wood with iron
rings.</p>

<p>The country surrounding the city seems dreary
enough until the intense fascination of the wildly
desolate land and the extreme purity of the air grows
more and more upon the mind. The jagged rock-hills
all round are never quite free from snow, but
they were thrown up by the earth fires too late to be
planed down by ice. The well-known little ponies
of Iceland in considerable numbers wander at will over
the rough rolling pasture land, save that some are
ridden by tourists from the south, and some by radiant
Icelandic girls. These come jogging in from the
country on their curious flat side-saddles, both feet
resting on a wide hanging step. They wear their
hair in four plaits, the ends of which are looped up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
under a little flat cap of black cloth. From the
centre of the cap there hangs through a little silver
cylinder a long black tassel which reaches to the
shoulder.</p>

<p>The ground is largely dug into hummocks so as to
increase the area available for grass. A good road,
fringed by telegraph poles each side and patronised by
a fair number of cyclists, leads out of the town, and
after a mile or two crosses the Ellidaar, which has
cut a broad winding channel through the hard volcanic
rock, and is famous for fishing.</p>

<p>Nearer the sea are the hot springs whose waters
send up steam that is visible from far, and gave
the capital its name. The ponies are kept from burning
their noses by stretches of barbed wire. In water
heated by the fires that burn far down, beyond the
reach of man, the people of Reykjavik have long
been wont to wash their linen and their clothes. A
constant procession of women bear soiled things to
the spring and clean things to the town.</p>

<p class="b1">Many Icelanders speak English, and they are often
surprisingly well-informed, both concerning their
own history and the affairs of foreign lands. Still
read are the sagas in the land of their birth, and they
were Englished largely by Icelandic minds. There
are very good secondary schools in the towns, and a
College at Reykjavik itself. Though no elementary
schools exist, almost every one can read and write
from the excellent teaching in the homes. Reykjavik,
Akureyri and Isafjordr are fair-sized towns,
the former has a population of about ten thousand
souls, but the loneliness of life in many parts is evident
from the fact that the rest of the nation, about fifty or
sixty thousand in number, tending cattle and ponies,
and fishing for whale and cod, is thinly sprinkled
through some two hundred and eighty parishes.</p>

<p class="p1">Of the rocky islands in Reykjavik Harbour by far
the most interesting is Videy, the resort to-day of
ptarmigan and eider duck, in past years the seat of
one of the chief religious houses of Iceland, a Priory
of the Benedictine order. The founder and the first
Prior (1226-35) was one Thorvald, son of a Speaker
of the Law, who was fifth in descent from Gizor the
White. He was succeeded by Styrmir, surnamed
<i>hinn fródi</i> or the Wise, who was one of the editors
of the <i>Landnama-bok</i>, and died in 1245. The chapel
in which he worshipped still exists, a rude early
thirteenth century structure, plain oblong with
gables, built roughly of volcanic stone. The sole
original features are the very plainest of windows
under segmental arches. It is still used for service,
and has plain eighteenth century fittings with tall
screen, and pulpit rising behind the altar, all painted
green and blue and red. Three bells are dated 1735,
1752 and 1785. In the loft under the roof is a
collection of old spinning wheels. The absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
surnames, which is still a characteristic of the unchanged
Norse tradition of Iceland, appears on a
gravestone of 1820, to Viefus Scheving and his
wife, Aunnu Stephansdóttur.</p>

<p>This little chapel appears to have been almost the
only stone church in mediæval Iceland; even the
famous Cathedral at Skalholt, which was in every
way glorious above any other building in Iceland, the
finest and most precious in the island, was merely a
structure of wood.</p>

<p>From the highest point of the island of Videy
there is a really superb view over the plantless
mountains and the steepleless city across a few
miles of blue-black, white-crested sea. The island
pastures support fifty head of cattle and slope right
down to the shore, where the waves have carved
arches and caverns in the yielding rocks. The farmhouse
by the chapel is a long stone building, whose
weathering by the storms of some two hundred
winters is concealed by a coat of whitewash, while
the rooms are comfortably panelled within. The
outhouses seem in some cases to be on foundations
that were laid by the monks, for the monastic buildings
were evidently detached in the Celtic fashion; there
was no attempt to reproduce the conventional plan
of a monastery that is so unvaried in southern lands.</p>

<p>Iceland belongs geographically rather to America
than to Europe, a much wider stretch of ocean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
divides her from Norway than from Greenland.
But so close are the lands in the Far North that a
present-day steamer might sail with ease from London
to New York, permitting her passengers to go ashore
for some part of every day.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Five hundred years before Columbus crossed the
Western Ocean Icelandic barks had plowed their
way, first to Greenland, then to the American mainland.
The latter their crews called Vinland from its
vines and surnamed from its character "the Good."
In the <i>Saga of Olaf Tryggvison</i> we read: "That
same spring also King Olaf sent Leif Ericson to
Greenland to bid christening there; so that same
summer he went thither. He took up a ship's crew
on the sea who had come to nought, and were lying
on the wreck of the ship; and in that journey found
he Vinland the Good, and came back in harvest-tide
to Greenland." In the <i>Vinland Voyages</i>, commonly
called the <i>Saga of Eric the Red</i>, the North
American coast is described with great accuracy, but
unfortunately still greater brevity, "The land seemed
to them fair and thick wooded, and but a short space
between the woods and the sea, and white sands.
There were many islands and great shallows." Many
Icelanders in these latter days have emigrated to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
United States or Canada, and the son of one of them
is V. Stefansson, who, in the service of the American
Museum of Natural History, discovered the blond
Eskimo of Victoria Land known as Akuliakattamiut,
just possibly descended from the ancient Norse
settlers in Greenland. To-day (1913), in the service
of the Government of Canada, he is exploring the
polar ocean to the north of that wide land.</p>

<p>Sturdy independence and passionate attachment
to their weirdly beautiful island have always marked
the Icelanders, and though since the fall of the Republic
more than six and a half centuries have worn
away, the spirit of the nation has not decayed.
Even by the great Margaret (p. <a href="#Page_120">120</a>) they would not
consent to be taxed. In 1393 it is recorded<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>: "The
Stadholder brought forward the Queen's demand at
the meeting, when all the chief men promised to give
sixteen feet of vadmal (cloth used for barter) for
Vigfus' sake&mdash;he was very much beloved in Iceland;
but on this condition, that it should not be called a
tax, and should not be demanded again. But the
inhabitants of Eyafjordr refused to give anything."</p>

<p>And about the year 1000, while other Europeans
were trembling for the end of the world or wondering
why it had not come, Icelandic sailors, who knew not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fear, were wandering admiringly through the woods
of the North American Continent, were warring with
the Scraelings or Indians, were eating the grapes of
the New World, were planning settlements, possibly
building churches,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> in what became New England
more than six centuries later. What boundless
possibilities were before them had they only realised
the value of that land! How different the history
of mankind if any considerable number of their
countrymen, sprinkled through all lands from the
ice-fields of Greenland to the Russian steppes, and
from the North Cape to Constantinople, had been
summoned from their widely-scattered stations for
the settlement of Vinland the Good!</p>

in the fact that a large steamer may sail far into
the heart of her lofty mountains through winding
valleys, enclosed by towering rock sides, over which
fall streams with courses so steep that they sometimes
reach the surface of ocean only in the form of spray.
In Norway one may proceed up a wild Highland glen
with scenery grander than anything even in Scotland,
without leaving the surface of the sea. Here and
there such river gorges as that of the Hudson near
West Point are somewhat recalled to one's mind, but
on the whole the scenery of Norway is not at all like
anything else. The overpowering vastness of it all
is perfectly unique.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>But, even if one has not realised the fact amid the
romantic scenery of those fjords where the works
of man are confined to tiny fields like handkerchiefs
scantily stretched upon the mountain sides, and
settlements of wooden huts which are lost among
the towering mountains of God, in Trondhjem
Fjord one can hardly ignore the fact that this northern
land has a history and a mythology of no mean kind,
and one that is her very own. Though they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
added less to the general sum of human action than
have the thoughts of Greece and the achievements of
Rome, the mythology of the North is more robust, its
history is more virile, its literature is less voluptuous,
its feelings more stern and deep. As the Swedish
poet and bishop, Esaias Tegnér, expresses it: "Go
to Greece for beauty of form, but to the North for
depth of feeling and thought."</p>

<p>Doubtless the difference is largely geographical,
as is well set forth in a thought-provoking passage
of Sir Archibald Geikie's Romanes Lecture, delivered
at Oxford in 1898. "Who can doubt that the legends
and superstitions of ancient Greece took their form and
colour in no small measure from the mingled climates,
varied scenery and rocky structure of that mountainous
land, or that the grim, litanic mythology of
Scandinavia bears witness to its birth in a region
of rugged snowy uplands under gloomy and tempestuous
skies." And to those of English speech
at least the history of the North should mean much
more, because it was not merely our teachers and
civilisers, but our very selves that first launched
dragon-prowed vessels on these clear waters and first
heard the eddas recited by the Skalds.</p>

<p>Just to the right of the spot where the broad river
Nid pours its rather muddy waters into the Trondhjem
Fjord, there rises a low hill, and there, commanding
a glorious prospect far over the brown-green mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and the slate-blue waters of the sea, once stood
a great Temple for the worship of the Gods whose
names are hourly on our lips, whenever we need to
distinguish the days. A mighty line of Earls once
had their seat in Ladir or Lade&mdash;for such are the
ancient and modern names of the village where
the Temple stood&mdash;and widely their authority was
known. The greatest of them ruled over all the Norse
for a quarter of a century (970-995), but so proud
was he of his ancestral stock that he preferred to
be known as the Earl of Ladir rather than as King of
Norway. Sixteen earls recognised his sway, and he
trowed in the old Gods.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Heimskringla</i> describes his sway. "Whiles
Earl Hakon ruled in Norway was the year's increase
good in the land. And good peace there was betwixt
man and man among the bonders.</p>

<p>"Well beloved of the bonders was the earl the more
part of his life, but as his years wore, it was much
noted of the earl that he was mannerless in dealing
with women.... Whereof he won great hatred
from the kin of such women, and the bonders fell
a-murmuring sore against it, even as they of Thrandheim
are wont to do when aught goeth against their
pleasure."</p>

<p>Now a mysterious person named Oli was at Dublin,
at that time a great settlement of Norsemen. Concerning
him the earl heard rumours that he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
exceedingly disquieting. He had a great friend
called Thorir Klakka, "who was long whiles at viking
work, but whiles would go cheaping voyages, and
was of good knowledge of lands. Him Earl Hakon
sent West-over-sea, bidding him go a cheaping
voyage to Dublin, as many folk were wont, and
look into it closely what this man Oli was; and if he
found that he verily was Olaf Tryggvison, or any
other offspring of the kingly stem of the North, then
was Thorir to entangle him with guile if he might
bring it to pass."</p>

<p>Thorir had no difficulty in getting into conversation
with Oli, and in reply to his questions about
the conditions in Norway, he told how the earl was
so mighty a man that none durst speak but as he
would. Yet he admitted that many mighty men, yea,
all the people, would be most fain and eager to have
a king for the land come of the blood of Harald Fairhair.</p>

<p>"Now when they had oft talked in this wise,
Olaf bringeth to light before Thorir his name and
kin, and asked his rede, what he thought of it, if Olaf
should fare to Norway, whether the bonders would
take him for king. But Thorir egged him on full fast
to the journey, and praised him much and his prowess.
So Olaf fell a-longing sorely to fare to the land of
his fathers: and he saileth from the west with five
ships, first to the South-Isles, and Thorir was in
company with him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>So Olaf got back eventually to the kingdom of his
fathers, and "when he came north to Agdaness he
heard that Earl Hakon was in the firth, and withal
that he was at strife with the bonders. And when
Thorir heard tell of these things, then were matters
gone a far other way than he had been deeming;
for after the battle with the Jomsburg vikings (notable
pirates whose stronghold was in Pomerania)
were all men of Norway utterly friendly to Earl
Hakon for the victory he had gotten, and the deliverance
of all the land from war; but now so ill had
things turned out that here was the earl at strife
with the bonders, and a great lord come into the
land."</p>

<p>There was a man named Worm Lyrgia, a wealthy
bonder, and he had to wife one who was known as
the Sun of Lund, where her father dwelt; she was
the fairest among women. Thralls came from the
Earl of Ladir to carry her away by force, but Worm
(despite his name) was a man of spirit and fire.
He "let the war-arrow fare four ways through the
countryside with this bidding withal, that all men
should fall with weapons on Earl Hakon to slay him."
This incident, which was far from being an isolated
case, proved very unfortunate for the government of
the earl; in fact, he soon became a fugitive with a
single thrall, named Kark.</p>

<p>"Then he arose, and they went to the stead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Rimul, and the earl sent Kark to Thora, bidding
her come privily to him. So did she, and welcomed
the earl kindly, and he prayed her to hide him for
certain nights till the gathering of the bonders went
to pieces. Said she: 'They will be seeking thee
here about my stead both within and without; for
many wot that I would fain help thee all I may, but
one place there is about my stead where I deem that
I would not think of seeking for such a man as thou,
a certain swine-sty to wit.'</p>

<p>"So they went thither: and the earl said: 'Make
we ready here; for we must take heed to our lives
first of all.' Then dug the thrall a deep hole therein,
and bore away the mould, and then laid wood over
it. Thora told the earl the tidings how Olaf Tryggvison
was come into the mouth of the firth, and had
slain Erland his son.</p>

<p>"Then went the earl into the hole and Kark with
him, and Thora did it over with wood, and strawed
over it mould and muck and drave the swine thereover.
And this swine-sty was under a certain big
stone."</p>

<p>So the bonders and Olaf fell straightway into good
friendship, and the son of Tryggvi ascended the throne
of his fathers. He was one of the greatest of the
kings of the Norse, superior in many respects to his
namesake, who is distinguished as the saint. The
chief secret of his power is opened to us by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
following passage from the <i>Faereyinga Saga</i>, for popularity
in the viking age was gained by much the
same qualities that secure it in an English Public
School to-day. "Once in the spring King Olaf said
to Sigmund. 'We will amuse ourselves to-day,
and prove our feats of skill.' 'I am not the man for
that, lord,' said Sigmund, 'but thou shalt have thy
way in this as in all other things that are in my
hands.' Then they tried their might in swimming
and shooting and other feats of skill and strength, and
men say that Sigmund came very nigh the king in
many feats, albeit he came short of him in all, as did
every other man that was then living in Norway."</p>

<p>To return to the swine-sty in the <i>Heimskringla</i>.
Olaf came to seek the earl at Thora's stead as she had
said he would. Then he "held a House-Thing out
in the garth, and himself stood up on that same big
stone that was beside the swine-sty.</p>

<p>"There spake Olaf to his men, and some deal of his
speaking was that he would with wealth and worth
further him who should bring Earl Hakon to harm.</p>

<p>"Now this talk heard the earl, and Kark, and they
had a light there with them; and the earl said:
'Why art thou so pale, or whiles as black as earth?
Is it not so that thou wilt bewray me?'</p>

<p>"'Nay,' said Kark.</p>

<p>"'We were born both on one and the same night,
said the earl, 'nor shall we be far apart in our deaths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then fared King Olaf away as the eve came on,
but in the night the earl kept himself waking, but
Kark slept and went on evilly in his sleep. Then the
earl waked him and asked what he dreamed: and
he said, 'I was e'en now at Ladir and King Olaf
laid a gold necklace on the neck of me.'</p>

<p>"The earl answered: 'A blood-red necklace shall
Olaf do about thy neck whenso ye meet. See thou
to it; but from me shalt thou have but good even as
hath been aforetime; so bewray me not.'</p>

<p>"So thereafter they both waked, as men waking
one over the other.</p>

<p>"But against the daybreak the earl fell asleep, and
speedily his sleep waxed troubled, till to such a
pitch it came that he drew under him his heels and
his head as if he would rise up, and cried out high
and awfully.</p>

<p>"Then waxed Kark adrad and full of horror, and
gripped a big knife from out his belt, and thrust it
through the earl's throat and sheared it right out.
That was the bane of Earl Hakon.</p>

<p>"Then Kark cut the head from the earl, and ran
away thence with it; and he came the next day to
Ladir, and brought the earl's head to King Olaf, and
told him all these things that had befallen in the going
of him and Earl Hakon, even as is here written.</p>

<p>"Then let King Olaf lead him away thence, and
smite the head from him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>At Ladir thereafter King Olaf made a feast and bade
to it lords and other great bonders. "But when the
feast was arrayed, and the guests were come, the first
eve was the feast full fair and the cheer most glorious,
and men were very drunk; and that night slept all
men in peace there.</p>

<p>"But on the morrow morn when the king was clad
he let sing mass before him, and when the mass was
ended the king let blow for a House-Thing. And all
his men went from the ships" (a "goodly host and
great" of them were laid in the Nid) "therewith,
and came to the Thing. But when the Thing was
established the king stood up and spake in these
words: 'A Thing we held up at Frosta, and thereat
I bade the bonders be christened; and they bade me
back again turn me to offering with them....
But look ye, if I turn me to offering with you, then
will I make the greatest blood-offering that is, and
will offer up men; yea, and neither will I choose
hereto thralls and evil-doers; but rather will I choose
gifts for the gods the noblest of men.'"</p>

<p>He proceeded to name some of the chief men present.
This was a convincing argument, and when
the bonders saw that they lacked might to meet the
king, they professed their willingness to trow in the
faith of the White Christ. And at Ladir, on the site
of the Godhouse, the king let build a church. A
Romanesque doorway about a century later than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
his time still exists in the south wall of the chancel,
under which is a crypt; but the present church is a
very plain plastered structure, dated 1694; a porch
was added in 1767.</p>

<p>Close by, in the year 996, King Olaf Tryggvison
raised a city on Nid bank. He chose a site at the
very mouth, almost surrounded by the stream, and
he desired that his town should be such as he had
seen in Christian lands. He would that the Norse
should resemble other Europeans, should trow in
Christ and dwell in towns and grow rich by trade.
The new settlement was known as Nidaros, because
it was at the mouth of the Nid, or else as Kaupstad,
because it was a merchants' town. But during the
sixteenth century it was called as we know it to-day,
taking its name from the district round. At first it
did not prosper, for though Olaf Tryggvison gave
men tofts whereon to build them houses, they did
not want a town, nor aught but their farms and their
ships.</p>

<p>But when the holy bones of another Olaf, martyr
and king and saint, were there enshrined and over
them sprang the tall vaulting of Scandinavia's
fairest church, pilgrims and trade and prosperity
resorted to the mouth of the Nid.</p>

<p>Little of the saint was in Olaf Haraldson during
his earlier years. The first story of him in the sagas
displays him as a mischievous boy. "On a time it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
befell that King Sigurd would ride away from his
house, and no man was home at the stead; so he
bade Olaf, his stepson, to saddle him a horse. Olaf
went to the goat-house, and took there the biggest
buck-goat and led it home, and laid thereon the
saddle of the king, and then went and told him he
had harnessed him the nag."</p>

<p>A renowned viking he became, whose deeds men
talked about in all the lands from Sweden to the
British Isles. But as King of Norway he would have
no peace but with believers in the White Christ.
Perhaps his methods lacked charity and tact, and his
temper lacked control, that he was wealth-grasping,
the sagas distinctly say, but he was truly of a religious
frame and in comparison with his faith he counted
not anything dear.</p>

<p>At the time when he was establishing his power
the city that Olaf Tryggvison had founded on Nid-bank
was already in decay. King Olaf the Saint,
we read in the <i>Heimskringla</i> "gat him gone at his
speediest and held out to Nidoyce, where King Olaf
Tryggvison had let set a cheaping-stead and reared a
king's-house; but before that there was only one
house in Nidness, as is writ before. But when King
Eric became ruler of the land, he favoured Ladir,
where his father had had his chief abode, but he left
unheeded the houses which King Olaf had let build
on the Nid; and some were now tumbled down, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
othersome, though standing, were scarce meet for
dwelling in. King Olaf steered his ships up into the
Nid; and forthwith he let dight for dwelling the
houses yet standing, and reared those up again which
were fallen down, and had thereat a throng of men;
and he let flit into the houses both the drink and the
victuals, being minded to sit there Yule-tide
over."</p>

<p>Thrandheim "he deemed was all the pith of the
land" (and thither he fared at his speediest), "if he
might there bring the folk down under him while the
earl was away from the land. But when King Olaf
came to Thrandheim, then was no uprising against
him there, and there he was taken to king; and he
set him down there in the harvest-tide at Nidoyce,
and there dight him winter-quarters. He let house
a king's garth, and reared Clement's Church there
whereas it now standeth. He marked out tofts for
garths, and gave them to goodmen, and chapmen,
or to any others he would, and who were minded to
house. He sat there with many men about him, for
he trusted the Thrandheimer's good faith but little,
if so be the earl should come back to the land."</p>

<p>A few chapters further on the court of the king is
described.... "King Olaf let house a king's
garth at Nidoyce. There was done a big court hall
with a door at either end, but the high-seat of the
king was in the midmost of the hall. Up from him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sat Grimkel, his court-bishop, and next to him again
other clerks of his; but down from the king sat his
counsellors. In the other high-seat straight over
against him sat his marshal, Biorn the Thick, and then
the guests. If men of high degree came to King
Olaf, they were well seated.... Withal he had
thirty house-carles to work all needful service in the
garth, and at whatso ingatherings were needful;
he had many thralls withal. In the garth also was
a mickle hall, wherein slept the bodyguard, and there
was withal a mickle chamber wherein the king held
his court councils."</p>

<p>His canonisation came to pass thus. His vigorous
propaganda on behalf of the true faith was by no means
universally approved in Norway, and he had to take
refuge in Russia (p. <a href="#Page_231">231</a>). Thence he returned to
recover his kingdom, but even in almost desperate
straits he would be succoured by none other than
Christian men. One Arnliot Gellini offered his
services and the king asked at once of his faith.
"But he said this of his troth, that he trowed in his
might and main. 'And that belief has served me full
well hitherto; but now I am minded to trow in thee,
O King.'</p>

<p>"The king answered: 'If thou wilt trow in me,
then thou shalt believe in what I teach thee. Thou
shalt believe this, that Jesus Christ has created
heaven and earth and all men, and that to him shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
fare after death all those who are good, and who
believe aright.'</p>

<p>"Arnliot answered: 'I have heard tell of the
White Christ, but I am not well learned in his doings,
nor where he ruleth; so I will now believe all that
thou hast to tell me, and I will leave all my matter
in thy hand.'</p>

<p>"Then Arnliot was christened, and the king taught
him as much of the faith as he deemed was most
needful, and arrayed him to the vanward battle-array,
and before his own banner."</p>

<p>On the field of Sticklestead, a few miles from
Trondhjem, Olaf fell in fight against foes who were
supported by English gold, for Knut the Rich, though
a Christian himself, was planning a vast Empire of the
North, and his political zeal was stronger than his
enthusiasm for the holy faith (p. <a href="#Page_115">115</a>). His viceroy
in Norway was one Hakon, the last of the stout Earls
of Ladir, to whom he gave a court-bishop named
Sigurd, a Dane. "That Bishop was a man masterful,
and pompous of speech; he gave King Knut all the
word-propping he might, and was the most unfriend
of King Olaf."</p>

<p>The Christian host went down before the troops
whose faith was mixed, and after various adventures,
the body of the king was buried at Nidaros, or Trondhjem,
in Clement's Church, which he had built.
"That winter uphove the word of many men there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in Thrandheim<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> that King Olaf was a truly holy man,
and that many tokens befell at his holy relic. And
then many began to make vows to King Olaf about
those matters whereon they had set their hearts.
From such vows many folk got bettering." "Next
summer there grew up mickle talk about the holiness
of King Olaf, and all word-rumour about the king
was changed."</p>

<p>When Grimkel the bishop caused the chest of the
king to be opened there was glorious fragrance, and
when the face was exposed the lips were as ruddy
as if Olaf had just gone to sleep. And so by degrees,
as miracles increased, and old sharp feelings wore
away, Olaf became the patron saint of all the Norse;
Churches were raised to him in many lands, including
a fair sprinkling in English seaports from Exeter to
York.</p>

<p>The Cathedral that rose to enshrine the relics of
St. Olaf would be a striking feature of any city in the
world, and it completely dominates this far northern,
low-roofed town. Both from far off and near it is
a Church of very English type, and it stands in a
regular close amid fair trees and grass. The vegetation
indeed seems more to suit the English south
than a spot not far outside the Arctic Circle. It
forms an impressive illustration of the influence
that the warm currents of ocean exert upon westward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
looking shores. For the opposite point of
America is north of Labrador.</p>

<p>It has been in the hands of restorers for about the
same time that the temple was in the hands of
builders, and very amply fulfilled is Du Chaillu's
prophecy that it would lose the quaint old look so
much esteemed by the lovers of antiquity (p. <a href="#Page_223">223</a>).
Much as some cry out against the restorer in England,
that country is far ahead of the Continent both in
reverence for the work of the past and in making
serious efforts rather to bind up what is broken down
than merely to present facsimiles of it to posterity.
Trondhjem Cathedral has been rebuilt rather than
restored, though Mr. Christie, the architect, has
strictly followed the ancient lines. Sarcastic people
might say that he has given us a building which ranks
high among modern churches!</p>

<p>Shortly before the earliest part of the Cathedral
was built, Nidaros became the seat of an Archbishop
whose metropolitan jurisdiction extended further
than did that of any bishopric before. In 1151
Nicolas Breakspear, once it is said a beggar at St.
Alban's, afterwards the only English pope,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> came
to set in order the affairs of the Northern Church.
He arranged for the formation of a province that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
should include all Christians of Norwegian stock.
The other sees in Norway (Bergen, Stavanger, Oslo
(p. 95) and Hamar) were placed under the supervision
of the Primate of Nidaros. Far over the sea his
authority was likewise known, by bishops midst
the British Isles, of Kirkwall in Orkney and of Sodor
(or the Southern Isles<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>) and Man, by the Bishop of
the Faroes, whose cathedral was at Kirkebö (p. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>),
by the twin Bishops of Skalholt and Holar in Iceland
and even by the first of American prelates, he who
sat at Garth (or Garde) in Greenland<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> far away,
knowing not that he lived in a different quarter of
the world.</p>

<p>Trondhjem Cathedral is a great cruciform church
about 325 feet long, whose nave and quire are aisled,
and the western towers project north and south to
widen the great façade: at the east end of the quire
is an octagonal corona, and on the northern side,
joined only by a passage, is the apsidal Church of St.
Clement, recalling the position of the Lady Chapel
at Ely. It is built of blue-grey saponite, a local stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
easy to work, varied with marble from the island of
Almenningen.</p>

<p>The oldest part is the transept which was raised by
the great Archbishop Eystein. He was the foe of
Sverre Sigurdsson, the knight-errant king, who in his
youth had been ordained, still ignorant of his royal
birth. In 1180 at a battle near Nidaros he contrived
to establish his power and the archbishop fled
to St. Edmundsbury in England, launching as a
Scythian dart against the recreant priest a sentence
of the excommunication of the Church. When no
one seemed in the least impressed, and the king's
power was waxing fast, the archbishop became more
prudent. Making his peace with Sverre he returned
to Nidaros and found less strenuous occupation in
building his cathedral. He died in 1188, and the
king gave his funeral address.</p>

<p>Each transept has the usual three storeys with
corner turrets and a square chapel opening on the
east. They are rich in shafts and arcading with
plentiful zigzag moulding, and they are really striking
examples of the style that the Normans brought to
England. The upper parts display a certain restiveness
to commence the development of later forms.
The present tower arches are modern.</p>

<p>Not much later than the transepts is the little
chapel of St. Clement, sometimes called the Lady
Chapel and sometimes the Chapter House. Its nave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
is vaulted in two bays and flanked by western turrets;
the roof of the apse is sustained by four clustered
pillars bearing pointed arches.</p>

<p>The quire and nave and octagonal corona are fairly
uniform in style but surprisingly otherwise in plan.
They belong to that period of Gothic architecture
when lancets were just giving place to traceried
windows, and clustered shafts and foliage caps
and deeply-moulded arches were more beautiful than
after or before. The works were in progress through
much of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and
evidently dragged on long. A bad fire gave a serious
set-back in 1328. It is doubtful whether the nave
was ever done. It was begun as early as 1248 by
Archbishop Sigurd, son of one of the brave birkebeiner
or birchlegs, who had helped King Sverre to
his throne.</p>

<p class="b1">The builders of each part seem to have been
profoundly unconscious of what their colleagues
elsewhere had been about. For they were working on
the foundations of three little older churches. St.
Clement's was built originally by St. Olaf himself, his
son Magnus the Good raised a church over his later
grave where now the corona stands, a stone church
of St. Mary was erected by Harald Hardredy (p. <a href="#Page_95">95</a>)
on the site of the quire.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Most awkwardly St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Clement's joins the rest of the church; the beautiful
aisle-encircled corona declines to meet the quire at
any understandable angle, the walls and pillars of
the quire itself trend apart on either side toward the
east.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> See plan opposite p. 246.</p>

<p class="p1">Over the great central tower, which long was cut
off by a low metal roof, have been raised a tall spire
of wood and four pinnacles of stone. It is largely
this lofty steeple in the centre that gives the Cathedral
so English a look. The magnificence of this fair
church is all the more striking when one realises that,
with a few most unimportant exceptions, it is the
furthest north of all the buildings of the middle ages.
Yet its equal is not to be found in any part of Europe
further south, till the latitude of Glasgow is
reached.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of Trondhjem to-day is that
so large and thriving a town should be almost wholly
of wood, even in the business section and including
the vast palace of the king. In 1872 the city
seemed to Du Chaillu (p. <a href="#Page_223">223</a>) singularly cheerless from
the large sections that had been burnt and not rebuilt,
while grass grew in many of the streets. Things
are very different to-day. The thoroughfares are
broad and straight, most of them pleasantly fringed
with trees, and there is all the character of a prosperous,
substantial town. A few wooden buildings are two
centuries old, for instance the vane of the Raadhus
is dated 1710 and that of the Hospitals Kirken<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
1704, but these do not in the very least affect the
general character of the place, and the aspect of the
streets as a whole is as modern as well could be.
The Cathedral quarter by a river bend seems to exhale
a quite different atmosphere from the whole of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
rest of the town. It is almost as though an English
close had invaded an American city.</p>

<p>Near the white square tower of the Frue Kirke
(dated 1739) is a wide open space where on market-days
stalls are erected and country and town deal
directly with each other in those picturesque surroundings
that are so largely the same all over the
north of Europe. The harness of the horses looks
primitive, and all the weight is on the shafts, but they
race along like the wind, and when a destination is
reached, the owner needs to do no more than to slip
round the front foot of his beast a long strap attached
to the carriage. Little of the Norwegian costume
that is so attractive a feature of the fjord villages is
to be seen in the city; the general life of towns is
becoming distressingly the same all over the Western
world. The atmosphere is, however, distinctly Norse
by the quays, where the fish boats come in and large
barrels of their catchings are rolled about, and also
where high wooden warehouses, not entirely without
picturesqueness, fringe the shores of the Nid and
exhale a smell of fish and tar.</p>

<p>The days of Danish supremacy are recalled on
a hill just east of the Cathedral on the other
side of the river by the picturesque old Fortress
of Christiansten, which dates from the seventeenth
century, and displays rubble stone walls surmounted
by grassy slopes and penetrated by brick-vaulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
passages and rooms. This period and this district
of Norway were chosen by Victor Hugo when writing
his first romance, <i>Han d'Islande</i>, which he published
anonymously in 1823. The scene is, however, laid
chiefly in Munkholm, a small rocky island which rises
out of the waters of the fjord immediately opposite
the town. In very earliest days of Christianity in
Norway a Benedictine cloister was reared there,
and for half a thousand years the monks remained,
but little beyond the name survives to indicate their
occupation to-day. Fortifications have long existed
where the psalter was chanted in days of yore.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo himself explains the object of
the work: "I wished to describe a girl who might
realise the ideal of all fresh and poetic imagination,
the girl of my dreams ... you, Adèle, my
beloved.... And beside her I wanted to set
a young man, not such as I am but such as I
would wish to be." He has certainly succeeded
so far that his characters are entirely French,
and he seems rather to have made a mistake in
placing the scene so far from France. The nightmare,
gruesome character of the book is bloodcurdling
enough, but decidedly overdone, and though
the work is very well worth reading as the early effort
of one of the greatest of writers, it contributes little
to his fame and still less, perhaps to the interest of a
visit to Trondhjem. The local colour is extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
poor, a fact that is hardly surprising when it is
remembered that the author had never visited
Norway.</p>

<p>The hills stand about Trondhjem, as indeed about
all other Norway towns; some of them display, five
hundred feet above the sea, marks of former beaches
where waves lapped cliffs unnumbered years ago,
before the movements of the globe had raised the land
so high. And from places within an easy walk of the
city, there is a magnificent panorama, westward
over hills riven in all directions by the jagged edged
sea, and eastward to the snowy mountains of the
Kiolen range that form the frontier of Sweden.
Superbly beautiful at all times is the prospect of
wooded hill and inland sea, particularly when seen
in softer outline as the long Arctic twilight gradually
gives place to the paler illumination of the moon, and
little lights begin to sparkle over land and sea. But
even in such dreamy conditions the city, beautiful
from its verdure and striking from its position, declines
to look like a mediæval or even a historic town.
Though for more than a thousand years the landscape
below has been the scene of the varied activities of
mankind, and from it has gone out power by which
the life of half Europe has been quickened, even yet
there is rather the restless atmosphere of new settlements
in a country still only half subdued, than that
of quiet peace and sense of satisfied repose, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
broods over an ancient Italian seaport, where every
corner has been transformed by untold generations
of man and centuries ago even the rough hill-sides
were terraced to enlarge his domain.</p>

<p>Some three miles from the city, amid pine forests
of perpetual shade, the River Nid plunges over hard
dark blue rocks to form the Lerfos Falls. Most
Norwegian cascades are chiefly spray, and by their
great resemblance to bridal veils are associated with
the happiest events in the lives of most of us. But
these are more business-like waterfalls, which are
not left in peace by mankind. The Lower Fall, or
Lille Lerfos, is a rather average sort of thing: in a
broad open place where much naked rock is exposed
the water of the stream plunges over a sort of stairway
to descend abruptly for nearly eighty feet, and the
effect is not improved by various works in cement.
A path along the wooded river bank leads to the
Upper Fall, or Store Lerfos, which is one of the most
beautiful anywhere to be seen. The stream leaps
down a hundred feet, and both high and low the
surging mass of whitened waters is cleft by tree-bearing
rocks, while mist-like foam spreads far and wide.</p>

<p>Europe has cathedrals statelier than that of
Trondhjem and mediæval cities of greater intrinsic
charm, but the interest of nearly everything is
affected chiefly by its position, and it is startling
indeed among the wildness of the northern fjords to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
come upon this history-haunted spot, to see this
fair cathedral rising from the trees and grass of so
English-looking a close. And in the long-drawn aisles
of the ancient Metropolitan Church it is strange to
reflect that the saint who was here enshrined in one of
the stateliest of Gothic fanes was the doughty Olaf
the Thick, famed in life for his wild viking career,
who knew the craft of the bow, and of all men was
the best in shooting of hand-shot, who was but
twelve winters old when he first stepped on a warship
to begin the harrying and burning in which so much
of his life was spent! And as the bright sunlight
streams through the lancet windows to illuminate
and shade chaste arcading and hanging foliage carved
in stone, with the deep mouldings of arch and vault,
it is difficult indeed to realise that one is hardly
more than three degrees outside the Arctic Line.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p class="pn p2">Cleaving the Skager Rak from the Cattegat the
small peninsula of Jutland projects far into the large
gulf by which the Scandinavian mountain mass is
riven on the south. And at the head of the gulf a
lovely island-dotted fjord penetrates far among the
hills that encircle the long and narrow Norway Lakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The shores of the fjord are rocky, in places eaten into
cliffs, pines cover all the slopes from which they are
not cleared. Just here and there distant mountains
of more jagged outline overtop the lower hills. For
some miles the seaway is narrow, but it broadens out
again before the end is reached. Less wild and rugged,
less grand and awesome, than the high-walled fjords
that cut into the western coast, but not less beautiful
in some respects.</p>

<p>By many coves the sea runs in among the woods,
and during saga days here lived sea-kings who never
slept under sooty roof-tree, nor ever drank in hearth
ingle. Into one of the arms of the branching fjord,
the water then called Drafn and now known as
Drammensfjord, hove Olaf the Thick, the Holy, with
his host in 1028, for he had heard that Knut the
Rich, England's all-wielder, was close upon his heels.
Knut was planning a great Norse Empire; he had
made himself master of Norway, and held Things
in every folk-land that he reached. Olaf could not
meet him in warfare, but he held him in Drafn water
in safety till he heard that Knut was gone south
into Denmark, and then he fared forth, only to find
that for the time at least the land was beguiled
from under him.</p>

<p>A few miles from the arm of the sea that had
sheltered St. Olaf another saint was born, related
to himself, Hallward, a worthy merchant of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
parts, who got his bane while trying to protect a
woman who was being attacked by men. Him Harald
Hardredy, the same who met his end at Stamford
Bridge in 1066, chose to be the patron saint of the
new southern town which he founded to rival the
capital far north.</p>

<p>In the <i>Heimskringla</i> we read how "King Harald
let rear a cheaping-stead east in Oslo, and sat there
often; whereas it was good there for the ingathering
of victual, with wide countrysides all round about.
There he sat well for the warding of the land against
the Danes no less than for onsets at Denmark, which
he was often wont to, though he might have no great
host out."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>After his death we learn that "it was the talk of
all men that King Harald had been beyond other
men in wisdom and deft rede, no matter whether he
should take swiftly, or do longsome, a rede for
himself or others.... King Harald was a goodly
man, and noble to behold; bleak haired and bleak
bearded, his lipbeard long; one eyebrow somewhat
higher than the other; large hands and feet, yet
either shapely waxen; five ells was the tale of his
stature. To his unfriends was he grim and vengeful
for aught done against him."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>To this appreciation we may add that Harald was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
no bad judge of the best site for a town; for with the
rocky forest-covered hills rising all round, and the
lake-like sea with its many islands gently rippling in
front, this capital has one of the best situations
enjoyed by any European town. Nothing but huge
advantages of site and greater nearness to the communications
of the world could have reconciled Norway
to her Government's abandoning the myriad
associations of the far more historic city in the North.</p>

<p>During the reign of Sigurd Jerusalem-farer (1121-1130)
to Oslo came from Ireland one Harald Gilli,
who said he was a Norse king's son, but he did not
claim the kingdom for himself. And Sigurd said
that Harald should tread bars for his fatherhood,
and that ordeal was deemed somewhat hard, but
still Harald yeasaid it.</p>

<p>"He fasted unto iron, and that ordeal was done,
which is the greatest that ever has been done in
Norway, whereas nine glowing ploughshares were
laid down, and Harald walked them barefoot, and
was led by two bishops. Three days thereafter the
ordeal was proven, and his feet were unburnt.</p>

<p>"After that King Sigurd took kindly to the
kinship of Harald, but Magnus his son had much
ill-will to him, and many lords turned after him in the
matter. King Sigurd trusted so much in his friendship
with all the folk of the land, that he bade this,
that all should swear that his son Magnus should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
king after him; and he gat that oath sworn by all the
land's-folk.</p>

<p>"Harald Gilli was a tall man and slender of build,
long-necked, somewhat long-faced, black-eyed, dark
of hair, quick and swift of gait, and much wore the
Irish raiment, being short-clad and light-clad. The
northern tongue was stiff for him, and he fumbled
much over the words, and many men had that for
mockery. Harald sat on a time at the drink with
another man, and told tales from the west of Ireland;
and this was in his speech that in Ireland there were
men so swift-foot that no horse might catch them up
at a gallop. Magnus, the king's son, overheard that
and said: 'Now is he lying again, as is his
wont.'</p>

<p>"Harald answers: 'True is this, that,' says he,
'those men may be found in Ireland whom no horse
in Norway shall outrun.'</p>

<p>"On this they had some words and both were drunk.
Then said Magnus: 'Now here shalt thou wager
thine head, if thou run not as hard as I ride my horse,
but I will lay down against it my gold ring.'</p>

<p>"Harald answers: 'I say not that I run so hard,
but I shall find those men in Ireland who so will run,
and on that may I wager.'</p>

<p>"Magnus, the king's son, answers: 'I shall not
be faring to Ireland, here shall we have the wager,
and not there.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Harald then went to bed and would have nought
more to do with him. This was in Oslo.</p>

<p>"But the next morning when matins were over,
Magnus rode up unto the highway and sent word to
Harald to come thither; and when he came he was
so dight that he had on a shirt and breeches with
footsole bands, a short cloak, an Irish hat on his head,
and a spear-shaft in hand.</p>

<p>"Now Magnus marked out the run. Harald says:
'Overlong art thou minded to have the run.' Magnus
forthwith marked it off much longer and said that
even so it was over-short.</p>

<p>"There were many folk thereby. Then took they
to the running, and Harald ever kept at the withers.</p>

<p class="b1">"But when they came to the end of the run, said
Magnus: 'Thou holdest by the girth, and the horse
drew thee.' Magnus had a Gautland horse full swift.
They took again another run back, and then Harald
ran all the course before the horse. And when they
came to the end of the run, Harald asked: 'Held I
by the girth now?' Magnus answers: 'Thou didst
take off first.'</p>

<p class="p1">"Then Magnus let the horse breathe a while;
and when he was ready, he smote the horse with his
spurs, and he came swiftly to the gallop. Then Harald
stood still, and Magnus looked back and called:
'Run now,' says he. Then Harald swiftly overran
the horse, and far ahead, and so to the run's end;
and came home so much the first, that he laid him
down, and sprang up and hailed Magnus when he
came."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Oslo stood on the Akers Elv, and was chiefly on
its eastern bank; Oslo-havn still exists, by the mouth
of the stream just eastward of the railway-circled
cape on which frowns the castle Akershus. Less than
a mile to the north, not far from the river's western
shore, stands a small twelfth century Romanesque
structure that belonged to a suburb of Oslo and is
prosaically known to-day as Gamle Akers Kirke.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Oslo was a great city, one of the chief centres of
Norwegian trade, and a bishop's stool stood in the
church where Hallward's bones were shrined. It
also played an important part in history when the
great king, Hakon IV., of the Birch legs party (p. <a href="#Page_85">85</a>),
overcame his domestic enemies there at a great battle
during 1240. He thus restored peace to Norway,
torn by the factions of a hundred years, and so widely
did his fame extend that St. Louis asked for his help
against Saracens and the pope for assistance against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the emperor himself. But, feeling more interest in
matters nearer home, Hakon preferred to direct his
attention to joining Iceland to Norway (p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>).</p>

<p>Old Oslo was, however, much damaged by fire and
wasted by war when about 1624 the illustrious Dane-Norway
king, Christian IV., rebuilt the city on a
slightly more western site and called it by his own
name. In addition to his other accomplishments,
which, as we shall see (p. 132) were very great, this
Christian was a brave soldier, and the song of Ewald
(d. 1781), "King Christian stood by the lofty mast"
has become a National Anthem of the Danes. He
fully realised the great advantage of having the Capital
of Norway as near Copenhagen as he could. Christiania
was but a few days' sail, Trondhjem was almost
in another world.</p>

<p>Of the new city's early days there still survive
memorials in the present rather picturesque seventeenth
century buildings of the peninsular castle of
Akershus, in the old brick Raadhus with its archway
and arcaded gables, and also in the Stor Torv, or great
market-place, with its untented stalls round the statue
of the Founder of the Town under the high spired
clock tower of Vor Frelsers Kirke, which is dated 1696.</p>

<p>The general character of present-day Christiania
was, however, given to it during the early years of
the nineteenth century when the city was largely
extended toward the west. Happily the early Gothic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
revival had not reached Norway then, and the chief
buildings are Classic, a style that is vastly to be preferred
to any other for buildings that are not really
among the best of their kind.</p>

<p>A decent, rather uninspiring town. Broad streets
with trolley-trams. Straight streets with shrubs
and trees. Houses of brick or cement. Numerous
little open spaces are, without much imagination,
devoted to the cultivation of such vegetables as grass,
elm, birch, willow, lilac and poplar. Like Capetown,
which in position it somewhat resembles, Christiania
depends for its beauty entirely on mountainous
surroundings, for there is little that is striking in the
streets.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that in the capital of a country
so extremely democratic, that has swept its nobility
into the mass of the commons, by far the most conspicuous
building should be the Palace of the
King, and that in the chief town of a land of such
strong national feeling, the main street should bear
the name of one who gained the crown of Norway
only at the point of the sword.</p>

<p>Few classic structures in the world are more magnificently
placed than the palace: it stands high up,
wide gardens stretch around, and through them the
great portico looks down along the broad, straight,
well-gardened, chief street of the town, called after
Karl Johan. Neither the architecture of the building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
nor the laying out of the gardens is at all worthy
of the superb position, but the effect nevertheless is
most striking. Were the Palace of Stockholm (p.
203) placed here and the park laid out on the same
lines as the gardens of Versailles, the great central
thoroughfare of the city being made a wide boulevard
to match, there might have risen on this spot one of
the most monumental and stately of all European
cities. Unfortunately the Palace was only erected
in 1825-48&mdash;when architecture was at its lowest ebb in
every part of the western world&mdash;and neither material
nor design is good. Karl Johans Gade, at whose
other end is the Hoved Banegaard, or chief railway
station, has gardens for a section of its length, but
for the most part it is unfortunately bordered by
houses of brick and stucco that rise straight from
the pavements. Nevertheless the grandeur of the
encircling mountains obliterates all minor defects.
In front of the Palace, looking along the great street
that bears his name, is a statue to Karl Johan, better
known to the world perhaps as Bernadotte, Napoleon's
marshal, who forgot his own country and his father's
house, to champion the liberties of the North, Scandinavian
in all but speech.</p>

<p>Where end the gardens by the street of Karl Johan
rises the Storthings-Bygning, or the seat of a parliament,
some of whose members reside within the
Arctic Line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">Across the same noble thoroughfare, nearer the
Palace, stand face to face the University, famed
for many a distinguished name and also for the
possession of viking ships, and the National Theatre,
renowned for its connection with the great name of
the dramatist whose appearance was tersely summed
up by Björnson:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn20">Tense and lean, the colour of gypsum,<br />
Behind a vast coal-black beard, Henrik Ibsen.</p>

<p class="p1">to whom a statue rises in the grounds. His charming
play the <i>Dolls House</i> (1879) was one of the first of his
works to gain a reputation through the world, while
it started, or stirred, about woman and her place a
discussion whose end is not in sight, and also did
very much to naturalise all modern drama by abolishing
such devices as soliloquies, and attempting to
set upon the stage what really happens in the world.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Well worth attention would be those very boats
that first explored the wild fjords of the storied North,
that pushed their unwelcome dragon-prows into every
bay and broad river of Europe from end to end,
that caused even the great Charles to weep, that
added a petition to the Litany of the Church, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>formed the navies on whose power were built kingdoms
in Sicily and Russia, in Normandy and amidst
the British Isles, that centuries before the days of
Columbus sailed through ice-laden seas to the well-favoured
American shore. Here they are! Put
together with skill and preserved with care, they
stand in sheds that form part of the University
Museum. That ships will be required beyond the
grave to sail on undiscovered seas is the simple opinion
of many unsophisticated branches of mankind. The
Chinese send vessels to the illustrious dead by burning
them on earth. Probably with the same idea the
ancient Norse buried them in their barrows or howes.
The ship on which a viking had sailed in life became
his coffin after death. Thus simply does the <i>Heimskringla</i>
in the <i>Story of Hakon the Good</i> describe such
burials. "So King Hakon let take all the ships
of Eric's sons which had been beached, and let draw
them up aland. There King Hakon let lay Egil
Woolsark in a ship, and all those of his folk with him
who were fallen, and let heap over them stones and
earth. Then King Hakon let set up yet more ships,
and bear them to the field of battle; and one may
see the mounds to-day."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Such a king's howe was heaped up long ago at
Gogstad on Sandefjord, where to-day is a prosperous
little watering-place, hard by the mouth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
seaway by which Christiania is gained. Here in 1880
a well-preserved viking ship was brought to light and
in due course it was reverently deposited in the
Museum of the University at the Capital. Its lines
are graceful and it is of very shallow draught. The
size is quite considerable, just seventy-eight feet from
end to end. It is framed with a heavy keel and rather
light ribs; the planks are extremely neatly cut and
carefully riveted together with iron nails and square
washers. It must have possessed some suppleness,
which was probably an advantage in a stormy sea.
The two ends are very much alike, but by the stern
is a steering-board, like a great oar, fixed loosely on
the side that we still know as the starboard.</p>

<p>Through the third plank from the top are pierced
rowlocks and along the gunwale are ranged the big-bossed
shields by which the Northmen sought to
ward off blows. They are round, not large, and painted
yellow and black.</p>

<p>Compared with those of Chinese junks or Arab
dhows, the lines of the viking vessel are strikingly
modern in character: this is much less surprising
than it otherwise would be when it is recollected that
the Bronze Age sculptures on the Scandinavian rocks
prove that boats of considerable dimensions had been
used by the ancestors of the builders for something
like a thousand years.</p>

<p>The dragon prow is no longer to be seen. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
features were clearly detachable, for among the
primitive laws and customs of Iceland it is written:
"This was the beginning of the heathen laws, that
men must not keep a ship at sea with a figure-head
on; but if they have, then they must take off the
head before they come in sight of land, and not
sail to land with gaping heads and yawning jaws to
frighten the spirits or wights of the country."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
Thoughtful precaution!</p>

<p>Near the centre of the boat are remains of the
pine mast that rose from a mortice in a log whose
either end is fashioned after the pattern of a fish's
tail. The square sail, perhaps of painted wool, was
hoisted or lowered by a pulley. Aft of the mast in
the centre is a log-built house, whose timbers, both
at the ends and those that on the sides lean together
to form the roof, fit into grooved beams, reminding
one of the construction of the stavekirkes. This
deckhouse in all probability was constructed to form
the tomb.</p>

<p>A well-found boat, suited to the navigation of the
fjords! But what courage must have been required
of those who sailed across the stormiest of oceans in
so frail a craft! Within the howe, but not within the
boat, twelve horses, six dogs and one peacock were
buried with their lord.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>The sun sets on the harbour over Bygdö, almost
an island, yet not quite. The famous Oscarshall is
on its eastern shore. In the deep shade of the woods
there has been formed such an open air museum as
all Norse love, and hither have been collected ancient
wooden buildings from country villages and from
isolated farms that give a good idea of some aspects
of the Norway of bygone years.</p>

<p>One of the buildings is of the kind called a <i>stabbur</i>,
a common adjunct to a prosperous farm. It formed
a storehouse, which could likewise be used for extra
sleeping-rooms whenever there was need. In the
upper chamber, reached by a ladder, were preserved
the initialled chests in which each member of the family
preserved his valuables, or hers&mdash;clothes to a large
extent. Thus each daughter had her trousseau
packed, ready for removal to her husband's home.
In this room, too, were kept blankets and tablecloths
and things we store in linen closets now.</p>

<p>The room below, which is narrower, for the upper
one projects to right and left, was used for such
things as grain bins and stores of food, bacon or
mutton or flour.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> (For drawing see chapter-heading.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>The stavekirke was moved from Gol, a small village
in Hallingdal passed by the railway to Bergen.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It
is an excellent example of a mysterious form of
Christian architecture that is confined to Norway,
nothing like it existing in any other part of Europe.</p>

<p class="b1">In a modern building surrounding a court is a small
but very interesting folk museum, divided into
domestic, commercial and ecclesiastical; it is dated
1898. A reredos carved in very high relief, which
displays Christ at the Last Supper gesticulating and
delivering an impassioned address to the Disciples, is at
any rate unconventional in treatment. Most of the
domestic furniture, such things as beds, chests, chairs
and even jugs, is carved in soft wood. Many pieces
are dated, usually in the eighteenth century, but the
collection begins about the year 1500.</p>

<p class="p1">So close against the hills the city stands that a
short electric railway lifts one in a few minutes from
the streets to the heart of the spruce woods that
cover the rock sides of Hollmenkollen. Among granite
boulders and such wild flowers as Scotland knows,
under the close shade of the pines&mdash;the woods
untouched, save here and there, as if miles from a
dwelling of man&mdash;one looks down on the streets of a
city that lies among the mountains and yet borders
upon the rippling sea. Still closer to the streets of
Stockholm the forests come, but there the hills stand
back. In being both girdled by mountains and
splashed by the sea Christiania is almost alone among
the capitals of the world.</p>

<p>Norway is almost always seen by visitors under
summer skies, unless it chances that they come for
winter sports; it is well somewhat to correct the
impressions received by recalling Björnson's holding
description of his own country: "There is something
in Nature here which challenges whatever is extraordinary
in us. Nature herself here goes beyond all
ordinary measure. We have night nearly all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
winter; we have day nearly all the summer, with
the sun by day and by night above the horizon. You
have seen it at night half-veiled by the mists from
the sea; it often looks three, even four times larger
than usual. And then the play of colours on sky, sea
and rock, from the most glowing red to the softest
and most delicate yellow and white. And then the
colours of the Northern Lights on the winter sky,
with their more suppressed kind of wild pictures, yet
full of unrest and for ever changing. Then the other
wonders of Nature! These millions of sea-birds, and
the wandering processions of fish, stretching for
miles! These perpendicular cliffs that rise directly
out of the sea! They are not like other mountains,
and the Atlantic roars round their feet. And the
ideas of the people are correspondingly unmeasured.
Listen to their legends and stories."</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pn center large b1">ROSKILDE</p>

<p class="ppn25">Between fair fields the fjord<br />
With winding waters, snake-like,<br />
Creeps inward from the salt sea.<br />
Where viking hordes have harried,<br />
Fare peaceful folk to market.<br />
High tower the tall twin spires.<br />
Beneath, in silent splendour<br />
Lie the dead kings of Dane-realm.</p>

<p class="pn p2">This pleasant, quiet country town is named from its
springs, referred to in the last part of the word (p. <a href="#Page_115">115</a>).
The uncertainty about the first syllable has apparently
led to the invention of a founder named Roe,
who seems to have so much in common with Port
of Portsmouth and King Cole of Colchester&mdash;that
he never existed except to account for a name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The atmosphere of a small cathedral city such as
Trollope describes is so peculiarly English that no
one would expect to find it reproduced in a foreign
land. The association of nearly all Continental
cathedrals with houses and market-place makes the
impression produced wholly different from that of
the grey towers and long roofs that appear over the
trees of an English Close.</p>

<p>But at least in the fact that the cathedral is almost
the only object of great interest, the centre of the
whole district, the ancient Danish capital resembles a
small English city. The atmosphere of farming and
of pleasant country life, the general sense of repose,
the way in which the cathedral rises among gardens
and flowers a short distance away from the market-place,
all do something to recall that most typical
cathedral city, the ancient capital of Sussex&mdash;while
the beautiful fretted fjord, bordered by low, sloping
meadows, and the port almost destitute of shipping
save for the fishing boats, bear very considerable
resemblance to Chichester Harbour and Dell Quay.
Knut the Rich is associated with that English district
too, his daughter is buried in Bosham Church. He
must have been frequently reminded while there
of the peaceful country round his Danish capital.</p>

<p>The story of Roskilde takes us pretty near the
dawn of strictly Danish history, when the country
was closely linked in politics with the British Isles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>At the present time, however, it is not so picturesque
a city as Copenhagen; there are but few old houses
and only a single mediæval church, that of St. Mary,
has survived, in addition to the great Cathedral of
St. Lucius. Even the Raadhus, or Town Hall, in the
very ample market place, was rebuilt not long ago.</p>

<p>The founder of the Danish monarchy was Gorm
the Old (p. <a href="#Page_12">12</a>); he first united all the land. About
935 he was succeeded by Harald of the Blue Tooth
(Blaatand). Him the Holy Roman Emperor was to
some extent able to control and insisted on his becoming
a Christian. Traditionally at any rate he was
the founder of Roskilde Cathedral, erecting a church
of staves where before no church had been. Men
say, the <i>Heimskringla</i> informs us, that Keisar Otto II.
was the gossip of his son, Svein Twibeard. So lightly,
however, did Twibeard regard the solemn ceremony of
his baptism that, heading the pagan party, he flung
his father from the throne and began to reign himself
about the year 985. More than once he changed his
creed, but it seems that he happened to be trowing in
the faith of the White Christ at the time of his unlamented
death. He it was who fought against Olaf
Tryggvison in the famous Long Worm at Svoldr,
but he left when the fighting was of the sharpest and
much folk fell. Nevertheless his Norwegian ally,
Earl Eric, who had a beaked ship wondrous great,
captured the Long Worm itself, when Olaf Tryggvison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
leapt into the deep sea and was never heard of
more.</p>

<p>While at war with Ethelred the Redeless in "England
it betid there that King Svein, the son of Harald,
died suddenly anight in his bed; and it is the say of
Englishmen that Edmund the Holy did slay him after
the manner in which the holy Mercury slew Julian
the Apostate."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> He is buried according to tradition
under the Castle Hills at Gainsborough on the Trent.</p>

<p>He had won a firm position on English soil, and
notwithstanding the victory of Ethelred the Redeless
and St. Olaf at London Bridge, his son, Knut the Rich,
the Mighty, the Great&mdash;for so he is variously called&mdash;eventually
established his power both in England and
Denmark.</p>

<p>Many a man has been improved by adversity,
many spoiled by great success. But, as Dr. Hodgkin
points out,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> two great characters in history, Cæsar
Augustus and Knut the Rich, vastly improved their
behaviour after realising their very highest flights of
ambition. Each was in a sense the founder of an
empire, one of them the mightiest and in influence
the most enduring dominion that the earth has ever
known, the other was of the flimsiest and most
ephemeral. Indeed it began to crumble before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
founder died. English communications were in those
early centuries mainly with the Scandinavian lands,
by whose people many parts of the British Isles had
been settled, and that Knut's dream of a great northern
empire was never realised we have some cause for
regret. Far more promising schemes, however,
would have been destroyed by the two savages by
whom he was succeeded. By Northmen speaking
French, under the great William, descendant of Rolf
Wend-afoot, whom no horse could bear, English
foreign relations were suddenly changed in 1066.
Hitherto it had seemed likely England might form
the focus of a great dominion of the North, henceforth
she was closely bound to the central lands of Europe.</p>

<p>Had the empire of Knut the Rich been maintained
its capital would probably have been Roskilde from
the convenience of its position, or if the wealth and
importance of England had made it desirable that
the chief city should be there, it would most likely
have been drawn to some place much nearer to
Denmark than Winchester.</p>

<p>Knut's own associations with Roskilde were by no
means uniformly happy. Indeed it was there that
he was guilty of one of the worst acts in his career.
In 1017 "King Knut rode up to Roiswell the day
before Michaelmas with a great following. Earl
Wolf, his brother-in-law, had arrayed a banquet for
him. The earl gave him entertainment full noble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
but the king was unjoyous and scowling. The earl
wrought many ways to make him gleesome, but the
king was short and few-spoken. The earl bade him
play at the chess, and that he yeasaid, so they got
them a chessboard and played. Earl Wolf was a
man quick of word and unyielding in all things; he
was the mightiest man in Denmark next after King
Knut.... Now when they had been playing
a while at the chess Earl Wolf checked the king's
knight. The king put his move back and bade him
play another. The earl got angry, cast down the
table and went away. The king said: 'Runnest
thou away now, Wolf the Craven?' The earl
turned back in the door and said: 'Further would'st
thou have run in the Holy River if thou mightest
have brought it about; nor didst thou call me Wolf
the Craven when I thrust in to the helping of thee
when the Swedes were beating you like hounds.'</p>

<p>"Therewith the earl went out and went to sleep,
and a little afterwards the king himself went to sleep.</p>

<p>"The next morning as the king clad himself he
said to his foot-swain, 'Go thou to Earl Wolf,' says
he, 'and slay him.' The swain went and was away
a while and came back. The king said: 'Didst
thou slay the earl?' 'I did not slay him, for he had
gone to Lucius' church.'</p>

<p>"There was a man hight Ivar the White, a Norwegian
of kin. The king said to Ivar: 'Go, and slay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the earl.' Ivar went to the church and up into the
quire, and thrust a sword through the earl, and forthwith
Earl Wolf lost his life. Then went Ivar to the
king and had his bloody sword. Said the king:
'Slewest thou the earl?' 'I slew him,' says he.
The king said: 'Then thou hast well done.'</p>

<p>"But after the murder of the earl the monks let
lock the church; but the king sent men to the monks,
bidding them to open the church and to sing the
Hours there, and they did even as the king bade.
And when the king came to the church he endowed it
with great estates, so that they made a wide countryside,
and thereafter this stead arose greatly."</p>

<p>The harbour was an almost ideal one in those days,
and Knut remained there with a great host of ships
all through harvest. He evidently felt that the land
given to the Cathedral of St. Lucius had quite atoned
for the crime. His life work was in one sense a failure.
The fabric he had reared fell down but much remained.
As his latest biographer has said: "The great movement
that culminated in the subjection of Britain
was of vast importance for the North; it opened
up new fields for western influences; it brought the
North into touch with Christian culture; it rebuilt
Scandinavian civilisation."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p class="b1">Knut's nephew, called Svein Wolfson (or Estridsen),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the son of the murdered man, was King of Denmark
from 1047 till 1076, and he did much for history
writing in the north by his conversations with his
friend, the famous chronicler, Canon Adam of Bremen.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
His courtiers had once become very drunk
in the palace hall at Roskilde, and without much
delicacy they began discussing their master's want
of bravery and lack of skill or success in war. Such
conversations are always overheard, and in this case
there was quite enough truth in the remarks to make
them excessively disagreeable to the king. He
relieved his mind by causing all the disputants to be
killed while at church next day; then he went to
service himself. But an English monk named William,
whom he had made Bishop of Roskilde, like
another Ambrose, sternly barred his way, nor was
he allowed to enter and attend the Eucharist till he
had humbly appeared in the garb of a penitent and
craved the pardon of the Church. A few days
later he imitated Knut by granting to the see a vast
tract of land. It seems to have included the site of
Copenhagen (p. <a href="#Page_131">131</a>).</p>

<p class="p1">During the eleventh century a stone church replaced
Bluetooth's building of logs. Knut the Holy, King
of Denmark (1080-86), gave what help he could. The
fact that this structure was on the same site as the
present cathedral may help to account for the extraordinary
irregularities in setting out the extremely
simple ground plan.</p>

<p>The church is almost wholly of brick, heavily
buttressed and rather German in appearance; it
must have been still more so originally when each
bay of the aisles had a gable of its own. With its
tall western spires and little central flèche, it reminds
one of the Cathedral at Lübeck, but is a very much
finer church. All the original parts were erected
during the thirteenth century, the builders working
east to west, delayed by fires in 1234 and 1284.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>A magnificent monument in the quire fitly commemorates
the greatest of all the honoured dead that
rest within this simple and most impressive church.
On an altar-tomb of great beauty and well restored
is the canopied effigy of a lovely woman, who died
in 1412. No student of history can tread here
unmoved. We are in the presence of the most far-seeing
of all the sovereigns of the North: the noble Margaret
of whom the great <i>Chronicle of Lübeck</i> says, "When
men saw the wisdom and strength that were in this
royal lady, wonder and fear filled their hearts."
She was a daughter of Waldemar Atterdag (p. <a href="#Page_161">161</a>),
and had married the King of Norway. "Great marvel
it is to think that a lady, who, when she began
to govern for her son found a troubled kingdom,
in which she owned not money or credit enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to secure a meal without the aid of friends, had
made herself so feared and loved in the short term
of three months, that nothing in all the land was
any longer withheld from her."</p>

<p>By the Union of Calmar in 1397, she arranged
the eternal federation of the four Scandinavian
realms on principles acceptable to all. One King
should reign, but each land should maintain its
proper laws. The Northlands realised the blessings
of her rule, and all that she did was so good that
even her wretchedly unworthy successors took a
century and a quarter to undo her work.</p>

<p>Womanish, perhaps unworthy, yet by no means
unprovoked, her mocking insults to the captured
Swedish King, Albert the Elder of Mecklenburg.
This carpet-bagger's German hirelings had been
scattered by her troops, and she dressed him in the
garments of a fool with a tail of nineteen yards in
length depending from his cap. Natural but unnecessary
return for his offensive gifts of an apron
and a long gown and a whetstone to sharpen her
needles!</p>

<p>To her memory (in part) are the beautiful miserere
stalls on whose canopies are Scripture scenes, set up
in 1420 by Bishop Jens Andersen. By her was fitted
the Bethlehem Chapel under the south-west tower.</p>

<p class="b1">Strong, indeed, in life, but yet more strong in death,
the appeal of the great queen! Even now the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
is a loser because the Scandinavian realms are torn.
Very truly spake a Swedish writer whom Otté quotes,
but does not name: "Death made an end of Queen
Margaret's life, but it could not make an end of her
fame, which will endure through all ages. Under
her hands the three kingdoms enjoyed a degree of
strength and order to which they had long been
strangers before her time, and which neither of the
three regained till long after her."</p>

<p class="p1">Other royal monuments are many here, but it
need not be assumed that the fairest of them mark
the livers of the noblest and most useful lives. Many
of them are in the numerous chapels which have
been added beyond the aisles of this church from the
fourteenth century to the eighteenth. They alter
the character of the building very much.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Combined
with the absence of any transept projection they
make the plan of the church look very confused.</p>

<p>Those who departed centuries ago are laid away
with decency in vaults. But in later days a far less
seemly custom has grown up; the coffins are merely
ranged in rows upon the chapel floors. They seem
to be at rest when they are of marble or stone, and
so, too, perhaps when of solid metal, but most are
only of oak, covered with black velvet. It is almost
impossible to dismiss the idea that the victims of
some disaster await the last solemn rites. There is
something weirdly gruesome in this vast Valhalla
of the unburied dead. Abraham desired decorously
to bury his dead out of his sight, but the rulers of
Denmark must for ever merely lie in state. In ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Egypt an empty coffin was sometimes placed upon
the table that the feasters might remember death.
They who say their prayers in this cathedral in the
very presence of the dead must surely learn that
lesson with much more force. To kneel on the same
floor where coffins lie must be far more impressive
than merely to learn from storied urn and animated
bust of those who sleep below.</p>

<p>Trondhjem Cathedral, the noblest of Scandinavian
churches, is without mediæval monuments, at Upsala
there are few; this church is in very truth the most
historical building of the North. Several of the
monarchs that here rest bore rule over all the Norse.
Saints of all three kingdoms have here some part.
To St. Brita is hallowed a chapel on the north, to
St. Siegfrid one under the northern tower. St. Olaf
(Danish Oluf) and St. Knut are among those whose
effigies are painted in the Chapel of Three Kings.</p>

<p>Few fences break up the wide fields that extend
round the town to the sea. Cattle are invariably
tethered, pasture is valuable, and none of it must
be trampled down. Sprinkled about are white farmhouses
covered with tiles or with thatch. Many
small-holders have purchased their land with money
borrowed from the State. Sir Rider Haggard<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> has
recently described their condition, and pointed out
what England may learn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<p>Denmark is, or rather has been, so progressively
indifferent to the past that but few old buildings
still adorn her open fields. When it was considered
necessary for a self-respecting Scandinavian nation
to establish an open-air museum,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> the needful old
farm buildings had to be brought from parts of old
Denmark that are now either Swedish or German.
Nothing had escaped rebuilding on strictly Danish
soil.</p>

<p>At first sight Danish farming looks rough, thistles
may not seldom be seen growing luxuriantly among
the oats. Danish landscapes indeed frequently look
rather more American than European with something
of that ungroomed appearance and absence of hedges
that is so characteristic of a new country. In purely
dairy farming, none the less, Danes practically
lead the world, and that despite their poor soil and
the need for sheltering stock from the rigours of a
long winter. Though about a hundred and seventy-four
of them live on each square mile, they manage
to send away food that they do not need to the value
of about twenty millions sterling every year.</p>

<p>Age-long the connection between this pleasant
land and the British Isles. Roskilde and Winchester
were twin capitals of the middle empire of which
England formed a part, after the legions of Rome had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
departed, before the British had built a dominion
in the world for themselves. Nor is the impression
the Danes left on England by any means worn away.
A Danish resident in Middlesbrough, taking a walk
with an English friend over the Cleveland Moors,
found himself able to understand the dialect of the
folk of those wild hills, while their own countryman
could not.</p>

<p>Political links with Denmark are to-day centred
mainly in the relations of kings and queens. But the
great smoky cities of the United Kingdom have their
chief source of the necessaries of life in this quiet and
green countryside.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Though the capital of an Empire which spreads from
the Tropics to the near vicinity of the Northern Pole,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
and by far the largest of Scandinavian cities, Copenhagen
is yet so placed that many of her citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
look from their own windows over foreign soil. The
capital is almost at the very eastern point of the
wide-flung yet restricted dominions of Denmark.</p>

<p>A flight of but a dozen miles would carry an aeroplane
on to Swedish soil; only twice that distance
off is the University city of Lund, so famous in the
annals of the Northern Church and so long on Danish
soil.</p>

<p>Copenhagen is a very pleasant town, and almost
all its chief buildings exemplify the architectural
ideals of the Renaissance. Street upon street of
houses, white stucco or red brick, adorned with
pilaster and pediment and cornice, covered with tall
pantiled roofs; many bearing the dates of their
birth-years two or three centuries ago; these give
the capital an old-world, most attractive look, a
picturesqueness that is sternly denied to most so
modern towns. Steeples of character to match,
frequently tower above the roofs, while very constant
parks and squares, long avenues of broad-leafed trees
and cool-looking fountains, some of them real works
of art, do much to make this town a very delightful
place.</p>

<p>Canals, somewhat numerous open-air markets and
innumerable cafés, whose tables and chairs under
trees or awnings encroach on the broad pavements,
make the Danish metropolis a rather characteristic
Continental town. In some ways, perhaps, it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
less individuality than the other capitals of the
Northlands. Less romantically situated, much larger,
far easier to reach from more southern parts, it has
much of the bright boulevard atmosphere of Paris.
Tivoli Park and the cafés, with many other like
attractions, draw crowds of visitors, not only from
every part of the small kingdom, but also from the
very prosperous section of Sweden across the Sound,
which was Danish till 1658, and has by no means
lost its affection for the city that it knew as the
capital of old.</p>

<p>Copenhagen is an epitome of Denmark herself,
the prosperous metropolis of an extremely industrious
and well-ordered community that likes to be amused.
There is but little rotten in the state of Denmark
to-day. Though fallen from possessing the widest
empire of the north to the limits of a mere province,
she yet thrills with vigorous life, an object lesson
on many points that no land can afford to ignore.
Copenhagen is not really very unlike a large German
town, though the Danes are not pleased to be told
so, and it lacks the numerous uniforms and those
minute and detailed regulations for the welfare and
good order of the population that so characterise the
Fatherland itself. Magnificently equipped with boulevards,
palaces and parks, cut through by fine waterways
and roadways, the city rather strangely lacks
any conspicuous central point. The Danes boast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that their large buildings are schools, while those of
England are factories and those of Germany barracks,
but the headquarters of one of the chief Universities
of earth possess little architectural splendour. The
view of the city from the deck of an approaching
steamer is not particularly impressive; nothing
except a few steeples rises above the general line of
the houses.</p>

<p>Life is lived in the Danish capital. Some of the
numerous bright restaurants do not close their doors
till 3 a.m., and there is much of the all-night activity
that is the unrestful pride of many of the cities of
America. To-morrow blends with to-day; some
citizens have not reached their beds while others are
starting on the activities of next morning. But
happily this unquiet atmosphere does not seem to
penetrate individuals. The Copenhagener does not
desire to be for ever talking about his hustling town.</p>

<p>While so much that is of the old world still survives
in Copenhagen, it is on the whole an intensely modern
town, rather dominated by its stretches of asphalt and
trolley-trams and ever growing lines of flats. A really
magnificent feature, by the chief square next the
Tivoli Park, emblematic of the soaring ambition of
the place, is the new Raadhus or City Hall. Built
in 1894, it is a beautiful specimen of Renaissance
architecture in brick, raising a tall spire toward
heaven, enclosing a couple of courts, one of them an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
open garden with a fountain in the centre, the other
cloistered and roofed with glass. The adornments
are very pleasing, appropriate to the style and use,
tile mosaic of fish and bird, tree designs in relief or
stencilling over the walls. The upper portions may
be gained by a lift that never stops; on one side the
cars are always going up and on the other down.</p>

<p>The site of the city, like its name, Copenhagen
or merchants' harbour, is not romantic, though
extremely convenient for travel and trade. It looks
straight over the Sound to Sweden and the entrance
to the Baltic; the arm of the sea that divides Zealand
from the small island of Amager (p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>) also penetrates
the town and adds to the water-front available for
wharves. It was on a little backwater of this channel
that in the twelfth century Bishop Axel (Absalon)
raised on Church lands a castle, which was called
by his own name, to protect the merchants from the
pirates infesting the Sound.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Little he suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
that round it would grow up a town to supplant his
cathedral city.</p>

<p>Copenhagen was made the capital in 1443 by Christopher,
the Bavarian, just after he had been recognised
as King in Sweden and Norway as well as in
Denmark itself. He was not a popular monarch.
The Swedes called him the stumpy little German, and
he thought them a free-spoken folk. When men complained
that pirates were ravaging the coasts and
were probably supported by Eric, the king who had
been deposed, Christopher answered that, having
been deprived of three kingdoms, a man could hardly
be blamed for stealing a dinner now and then. Perhaps
if the dinners had been stolen from the palace
and not from their own houses the people would
more readily have seen the joke.</p>

<p>Thus, Copenhagen is a mediæval town, but it has
no buildings earlier than the creations of that most
accomplished sovereign, Christian IV., who could
sail a ship and navigate the fjords and swim and leap
and fence and fight and ride and drive and speak
many languages and explain the course of the stars
and drink enough wine and beer to astonish the
court of his brother-in-law, James I. of England. If
he really designed the buildings that he raised, as it
seems he truly did, he was also an architect of no
mean power.</p>

<p>The Bourse, which he erected about 1624, presents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a long low façade to one of the quays and its high roof
is relieved by large gabled dormer windows. From
the top of the tower in the centre four dragons look
down and coil their tails heavenward together to
form a spire about a hundred and fifty feet high.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
Another of his works is the Round Tower,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> originally
used as the observatory. It is entirely filled by a
brick slope up which one may walk with ease to the
top, corkscrewing round a pillar. Over the metal
parapet that bears the date 1643, there is a splendid
view across wide miles of steep roofs covered with curving
tiles, relieved by many a tree and the tall masts
of many a ship. And the other spires and towers
and domes of the city make a really splendid array,
especially the quaint steeple of Vor Frelsers Kirke,
round whose outside an open stairway winds to the
gold ball at the top. Across the Sound loom up
low Swedish hills, but the city is too vast to allow a
view of Danish country of any decipherable sort.
Over thirteen miles of choppy sea appears the small
isle of Hveen, now famous for its hares, where in
1580 Tycho Brahe built his observatory and "wielded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the sword, not to smite flesh and blood, but to strike
out a clearer path up to the stars of heaven. For
Holger Danske (p. <a href="#Page_146">146</a>) can come in many forms; so
that through all the world one sees the might of
Denmark."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>In this teeming womb of royal kings one expects
to see palaces, and very numerous they are, now in
many cases put to every kind of useful purpose, from
the framing of laws to the display of things curious
and rare. But the sneer of Samuel Laing in 1839
that Copenhagen has more palaces in her streets
and squares than ships in her harbour has long
ceased to be true. The haven of merchants again
has a busy trade; canals and shipping and docks
are met with on every hand.</p>

<p class="b1">Two palaces, Rosenborg and Fredericksborg, were
erected (or begun) by the same fourth Christian king,
and fine specimens of Danish Renaissance they are,
far better in general effect than in detail. Walls
mostly of brick, carved work of stone, tall metal-covered
roofs and lofty open windowed spires. The
palace of Rosenborg contains a beautiful array of
furniture and weapons and china and jewels, the
collection of several kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Other of the palaces are fine examples of the
severer Classic work of the eighteenth century erected
when Europe had learned to call barbaric all that the
Christian centuries had raised, so ceased merely
to apply Classical details to Gothic designs, and could
admire nothing but plain copies of the work of Greece
and Rome. The Amalienborg (Winter Palace, etc.)
surrounds a fine octagonal court with Ionic pilasters,
balustrades and urns, over which rise high tiled roofs.
In the centre of the court is a metal statue to King
Frederick V., famed as the patron of science and art.
It was erected by the Asiatic Trading Company
which once made Denmark an Indian power, for the
king's interest in the East was great, and he dispatched
Niebuhr to Arabia in 1761.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Another eighteenth century palace, called Prindsens
because the Crown Prince adorned it when in
1744 it was erected round its court, is now the National
Museum. Even in the earliest age when "beasts
were slaying men" Denmark was the abode of oyster-eating
humanity which has left us the world-famed
kitchen middens that make so fascinating to us the
first beginnings of our race. This collection is of
extraordinary interest as letting us trace in a general
way the whole story of mankind from the time when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
he chipped flints into implements and built cromlechs
of unshapen stones to the days when he learned to
preach the message of peace from pulpits of Renaissance
architecture and to shoot his fellows with long
guns.</p>

<p>As is natural in Denmark the collection of prehistoric
implements is extremely representative and
large. We see man armed with rude axes of flint or
variegated marble and women adorned with amber
beads, during the long, long millenniums of the two
ages of stone. We see the swords and knives and the
tree-trunk coffins of those who had learned the secret
of the metals and substituted for stone first blunt
bronze and then sharp iron. We see the works of
Egypt and Assyria, of Greece and Rome, and of all
the cultured races of the South. We see the beginning
of civilisation in the North and the spoils of the Viking
Age, the gold and jewels brought to Denmark by
foray or by trade. We see the North becoming Christian
and building churches of stone or staves and the
Scandinavian countries moulding themselves into
what they are to-day.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> For purely educational purposes
and for stimulating the imagination few museums
on earth have quite the same power as this one.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Denmark is a country where education is a serious
thing, and in few capitals may one learn so much as
here. No amount of <i>merely</i> technical instruction
would give the Danes the technical skill that they
possess. If any doubt the real and practical usefulness
of good general education, this small country can
supply the object-lesson that he needs; if any do
not know just what education means, the Danes
have hit upon a definition that is of real value and
much comfort too. "Education is that which survives
when all that was learned has been forgotten."</p>

<p>Much of the spirit of the Norse fills the air of the
Danish capital, but the town is too young to be mentioned
in the sagas; to many of the heroes of the
Danes there are monuments in streets and memorials
in galleries, but they do not give their atmosphere
to the town. The spirit of the city is rather that of
solid achievement by a great people which no longer
rests its pride on glory gotten in war. And if the
nations of mankind were to be judged on the same
principle that was applied to the holders of the Talents
Denmark would be very near the top. The extreme
richness of her small homeland is a still unexploded
myth. If it were an American state it would be one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of the most thinly settled areas of the country, outside
the actual mountains. Denmark's place in the modern
world is due to education and to nothing else.
The sole fertility of the land is in the brains of her
children. If America were occupied by a sufficient
population of Danes she might almost take a contract
to supply the solar system with food.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Even in a city of so many associations and despite
the noble army of Danish worthies who have written
their names in broader or fainter type across its streets,
it is still the great name of Thorwaldsen that more
than any other dominates Copenhagen. "Sylvanus"
tells the truth in his remark: "Men speak not, think
not of the king; they ask you, 'Have you seen the
Frue kirk?' or Church of our Lady, within whose
walls are the twelve apostles of Thorwaldsen, with
the grandest, most holy conception of the Saviour,
the chisels of future ages may vainly essay to surpass.
The figures, larger than life and thrown <i>into</i> life by the
immortal Icelander, teem with varying expression
and deep feeling."</p>

<p>The exterior of the church is severely plain; indeed,
it is very ugly, with two ranges of windows and a tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
stuck through the sloping roof, a hexastyle Doric
portico against it. This last feature in itself is,
however, a thing of much beauty and its tympanum
has sculptures by Thorwaldsen.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The inside is very truly one of the most impressive
in Europe. Not that the actual architecture rises
very far above the commonplace. The aisles open
by round arches with heavy piers between; Doric
colonnades above sustain the deeply panelled tunnel
vault; there is an unlighted apse. Here, over the
altar, stands the famous statue of Christ, one of the
most striking in the world; the face radiates divine
compassion, the hands are stretched out to all who
come. In front an angel holds a font-shell, and
against each pier is the figure of one of the Apostles.
The supreme excellence of these glorious statues in
white marble with their effective drapery and the
absence of any other attempt at ornament renders
the interior of this church striking in an extraordinary
degree. There is an element of almost barbaric display
in the huge number of works of art collected in
many Gothic churches, and there is truth in the
Japanese contention that not more than a single
picture or figure should be displayed at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
time. If the statues were removed from the church
one would hardly cross the street to see it, but
were they erected in St. Paul's Cathedral they would
lose more than half their effect.</p>

<p>The only criticism that one can possibly make on
Thorwaldsen is that his long sojourn in Rome seems
to have given him a little trace of the softness of the
South, a certain absence of virility that, slight as it
is, attracts instant attention in the North. Not a
trace of this appears in the figure of St. Paul: determination
on every line of the strong face, clinched
by the position of the left hand on the sword.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> There
is a large collection of the Master's works in the
mongrel-Egyptian Valhalla next Christiansborg Palace
(p. 131), in the centre of whose court Thorwaldsen sleeps
beneath ivy trailing on the ground. Grace, tenderness,
youth, beauty, and gentle mirth&mdash;these were
the inspirations that gave his hand power. Nothing
fearful or terrible is among his works. No agony
like the Niobe or the Laocoon, never even the
crucifixion of the Saviour. Even in sepulchral
monuments he strove to lessen the gloom of death
by symbols of a deathless life.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Even with Thorwaldsen fresh in mind, it is probably
safe to say that the name of no Copenhagener,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
past or present, is so well-known in England and
America as that of Hans Andersen, unrivalled as the
teller of fairy tales. Few would maintain that he was
the greatest of the Danes or the most illustrious alumnus
of the University, but not very many are seriously
interested in statuary, and in science still fewer,
while all children love stories and there is an atmosphere
about those of Hans Andersen of which most
of us are conscious more or less from the cradle
to the grave.</p>

<p>In the rather risky work of foretelling the future
Andersen was at any rate as successful as any one
else. "Yes, in years to come we shall fly on the
wings of steam high in the air, over the mighty ocean.
The young inhabitants of America will visit the old
Continent of Europe. They will come to admire the
ancient monuments and ruined cities, just as we
make pilgrimages to the fallen glories of Southern
Asia.</p>

<p>"In years to come they will certainly visit us....</p>

<p>"The airship comes: it is crowded with passengers,
for the journey is quicker than by sea.... The
passengers will tread the country of Shakespeare, as
the intellectual ones of the party have it&mdash;the home
of politics and machinery, as others say.</p>

<p>"Here they stay for a whole day: they are a busy
race, but they can afford so much time for England
and Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"On they go, through the tunnel under the Channel
to France.</p>

<p>"One whole day is given to Germany and one to
the North&mdash;the birthplace of Oerstedt and Linnæus&mdash;to
Norway, home of the ancient heroes and of the
Normans. Iceland is taken on the return journey:
the Geyser foams no longer, Hekla is extinguished;
but an eternal stone table of the Saga still holds fast
the island rock in the midst of the stormy seas."</p>

<p>A delightful description of the writer himself is
given us by Lady Wilde: "Hans Andersen was
described to me as a tall, white-haired old man,
with the most gentle and lovable manners. The
son of a poor tailor, with no inheritance from nature
or fortune save his genius, he gained a distinguished
position in society and was an immense favourite
in Copenhagen. He read nothing but his own
works, and always talked as if fresh from Fairyland.
The children adored him, and he was never so happy
as when he gathered a circle of them round him,
while he enchained their attention with some magical
story fresh woven from his brain, and made them
laugh or weep as he chose, with the mirth or pathos
of his strange fancies."</p>

<p>Southward the city leaps a narrow arm of sea and
spreads on to the kitchen-garden island of Amager
or Amak. During the early sixteenth century King
Christian II., brother-in-law to the Emperor Charles V.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
famed for his noble work in organising schools in the
cities and instituting a system of posts, but infamous
for a stupendous crime that crushed the achievement
of the great Margaret in the dust (p. <a href="#Page_217">217</a>), invited
farmers and gardeners from the Low Countries to
colonise Amak. Great was the benefit both to immigrants
and Danes; the fertile island still retains
much of old Flemish ways and imports the old costumes
of Holland into the markets of the Danish
capital.</p>

<p>Of Anglo-Danish relations during the Napoleonic
wars, of Nelson's victory in 1801 and Wellesley's in
1807, silence is better than words. The conqueror
at Trafalgar has immortal fame without the added
laurels won in the Sound, the hero of Waterloo needs
not to add to his victories the operations against this
town. No Dane could be expected to look back on
those miserable events but with indignation, few
English but with very deep regret. Necessary, perhaps,
those actions, but wretched all the same. We live
in better days. The presence of the Church of St.
Alban in the lovely gardens by the very citadel, a
sanctuary to whose erection Danish Queen Alexandra
contributed, is a witness for all time that the relations
between Denmark and England to-day are of no
ordinary kind. The tall Gothic spire is an ornament
to the city and one of its landmarks from the harbour,
but there might have been advantages in less purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
English architecture and perhaps dedication to some
Danish saint.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The environs of the capital are made as delightful
as those of Paris by the lovely beech-woods that cover
so much of the land, and by the haunting beauty of the
views across the Sound. A few miles north of the city
is the famous Dyrehaven, or deer-park, a vast expanse
of gently undulating woods or grass land with a large
water-lily-covered pond, where deer roam about under
a few old oaks and many beeches, often so close together
that they have soared instead of being allowed
to spread. Beech woods are very dear to the Danes,
and in the Kunst Museum at Copenhagen there is a
striking picture by Philipsen of which they form the
subject.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> On a low hill in the park is the Eremitagen,
a hunting-lodge, in which the king can look out from
his own house over soil that another rules.</p>

<p>Along the Sound front there peep out from the
woods just one or two old thatched cottages with
heavy logs along their ridges, but far more prominent
are the modern villages, which are largely made up
of restaurants and hotels. Very many too are the
summer cottages of prosperous citizens; far toward
the north they spread along the shore, the bungalow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
kind of thing that has long been frequent in America
and is beginning to become naturalised in England too.</p>

<p>A tale is told of a Danish husband, not famous for
the best of tempers, who proposed to his wife that
they should celebrate their silver wedding, but rather
weariedly she suggested that instead they might wait
five years and then commemorate their Thirty Years'
War. This must have been a most exceptional state
of affairs, if one may judge from Danes one has the
pleasure of knowing, or from what one may see of
the race making holiday at these seaside resorts. No
European people seems to get more out of life and into
life than the always cheerful inhabitants of this small
land. It is the mark of true genius that, shut out
from so much, they have made still more of what
remains.</p>

<p>Less than thirty miles north of Copenhagen, where
the Sound is straitest, stands the town that is next
best known to the world of all on Danish earth.
The call of the future dominates Copenhagen, but the
romance of the past still broods over Elsinore, or
Helsingör, where Kronborg Castle looks across the
narrow sea. How it seems to Danish minds can
hardly be better told than in Hans Andersen's simple
and yet holding tale.</p>

<p>"Kronborg Castle stands in Denmark, close to the
Oere Sound, through which tall ships sail by in
hundreds, English, Russian, and Prussian. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
all greet the old fortress with their cannon, 'Boom!'
And the castle answers, 'Boom!' That is the way
the cannon say 'Good morning' and 'Good evening.'
In the winter, when no ships sail by, and the Sound is
covered with ice right up to the Swedish coast, it looks
just like an inland street. Danish and Swedish flags
are flying; Danes and Swedes cry to each other,
'good morning,' and 'good night,' but not with
cannon&mdash;no, with a kindly clasp of the hand. One
brings to the other biscuits and white bread, for
foreign fare is always the sweetest. But the most
beautiful sight of all is the grand old castle, in whose
deep inaccessible vaults sits Holger Danske. He is
clad in mail armour; his head rests on his strong
arms; his long beard has grown into the marble
table, where he sits asleep. He dreams, and in his
dream he sees all that happens in his native land.
Every Christmas Eve an angel comes to him, and
tells him that his dreams are true, but that he may
sleep on undisturbed for a while longer. Denmark is
not yet in danger, but if the danger ever comes Holger
Danske will spring to his feet, the table will shiver to
pieces as he draws away his beard, and the hero will
lay about him, so that every land shall ring with the
story.</p>

<p>"An old grandfather sat one evening telling his
little grandson all this tale of Holger Danske, and the
child knew well that what his grandfather said was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
true. As the old man spoke, he finished off a large
wooden figure of Holger Danske which was to ornament
the prow of a ship, for the grandfather was a
carver in wood, and had carved many a figure-head
from which a good ship was to take her name. Now
he had just carved Holger Danske, standing proudly
with his long beard; in one hand he held his flashing
sword; in the other the Danish shield.</p>

<p>"'It is the finest national arms in the world,' said
the old man. 'Lions and hearts&mdash;emblems of strength
and love!' He looked at the topmost lion and thought
of King Knut, who chained England fast to Denmark's
throne; he looked at the second lion and thought of
Waldemar, who gave peace to Denmark, and subdued
the Vandal's lands; he looked at the third lion and
thought of Margaret, who united into one Sweden,
Norway and Denmark. But as he looked at the
hearts they burned and brightened into flames;
each stirred in its place, and by its side stood a spirit.</p>

<p>"But the little child in bed saw clearly the old
Kronborg towering above the Oere Sound; he saw
the real Holger Danske, sitting alone in the deep
vault, his beard grown fast to the marble table,
dreaming of all that happened overhead. Holger
Danske dreamed too of all that went on in the little
room; he heard every word, and nodded in his
dreams.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he cried, 'keep me in your hearts and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
your memory, ye Danish folk. In the hour of danger,
I shall be at hand.'</p>

<p>"And the clear daylight fell over Kronborg; the
wind bore along the sound of the hunting horns from
the country round; the ships sailed by with their
greeting 'Boom, boom!' And Kronborg answered
'Boom! Boom!' But Holger Danske woke not,
let them thunder as loud as they might, for they only
meant 'good morning!' 'good evening!'"</p>

<p>In this castle too in 1589 James VI. (and afterwards
I.) was married to his Danish bride. That was only by
proxy so far as the Scot was concerned, but the next
year Queen Anne brought her husband to sojourn at
the well-loved spot.</p>

<p>By the sea is a long sandy beach and dark woods
cover the flat lands behind. The superb castle was
rising, or re-rising, from the ground during Shakespeare's
younger years (1577-85); he first went to
London the year after it was done. A grand sample
of Renaissance work, it stands four-square to all the
winds and protects a court within; details are carved
in solid stone. And at each angle rises a tower, all
different in design and height. A light for the shipping
burns in one.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The architect was G. F. Stahlmann.</p>

<p>The world fame of Elsinore is owed very largely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the immortal English bard who probably never was
there. On the flat terrace between castle and sound
Hamlet spoke with his father's ghost. The tale of
Amlet or Hamlet seems to be derived from some old
saga of a Jutish prince,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and the <i>Ambales Saga</i> gives
an Icelandic form of the legend.</p>

<p>True, indeed, that Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>, like his
other plays, whose scene is laid abroad, lacks special
local colour. But it is no weak link between Denmark
and the world of English speech that the scene of one
of the great masterpieces of Saxon literature, indeed
of all the writings of the earth, is laid on Danish soil.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pn center large b1">VISBY</p>

<p class="ppn20">Thou wonnest, O warrior-wager,<br />
Tribute from folk of Gothland,<br />
And durst not men against thee<br />
With brand to ward their island.<br />
So ran the Isle-syslings' war-host;<br />
I heard that the wolf-kind's hunger<br />
Thawed east-away.</p>

<p class="pn30"><span class="smcap">Ottar the Swart</span>, in praise of Olaf the Holy.</p>


<p class="pn p2">There was a time very long ago when a spectral
island floated on the Baltic brine. Its mist-wrapped
shores appeared at times to perplexed mariners,
but when they tried to land there all was sea.</p>

<p>It appears the reason was that certain trolls had
made that land their own, and sought to amuse themselves
by playing idle tricks on man. But the powers
of darkness can never last for aye and eventually it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
chanced that a sailor from the North, called Thjelvar
or the Diligent, more skilful or more fortunate than
others, contrived to land on the enchanted isle.
Knowing how to destroy the force of evil he at once
kindled a fire by which the spell was burned away.
The trolls were warned off. The land was added to
the realms of man and yellow crops waved where grew
dark woods of yore. But it was necessary that the
career of the new people should be mainly on the
water, and the island became known far and wide as
the Eye of the Eastern Sea.</p>

<p>The Goths, who did so much to overturn the Empire
of Rome and at the same time to rejuvenate the
South of Europe, have left no other account of themselves
in literature than the version of Holy Writ
that was made in their language by Ulfilas, a missionary
great and good, however deplorably incorrect his
views about the Trinity may have been (p. <a href="#Page_191">191</a>). But
to this beautiful island of limestone in the heart of
their oldest homelands the Goths gave at any rate a
name; and such is the charm and interest of her
ancient capital that one might well suppose the term
Gothic Architecture to have been given here in
admiration instead of being a term of contempt and
reproach bestowed by a generation that could see no
beauty save in the horizontal lines of Greek temples.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>At an early date the men of Gothland had done
in the Baltic what long before the Ph&oelig;nicians had
done in the Mediterranean. Their trading vessels
were moored to London Bridge, they were anchored
in the lonely gulf where St. Petersburg was eventually
to rise. And their commercial activities extended
to far remoter bounds. They fetched the furs of
Russia and the gems of further east to shelter English
men and to decorate English girls. No less than
twenty thousand English coins, most of them inscribed
with the unhonoured name of Ethelred the Redeless,
have been found in their island of recent years.
The further extent of Gothland trade is evidenced
by the presence of coins not only from Scandinavia
and Russia and the realms of the Holy Roman Empire,
but also from the far south of Europe and towns on
the Arabian sands.</p>

<p>In the <i>Saga of Olaf</i> we read of a merchant employed
by that king to purchase robes in Garthrealm, or Russia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and Gothland is visited on the way, as was doubtless
the almost universal custom of the time. "There
was a man hight Gudleik the Garthrealmer, of Agdir
kindred, a mariner, and a mickle chapman; wealthy
withal, and one who went on chaffering journeys
to sundry lands; he would often go east into Garthrealm,
and for that cause was called Gudleik the
Garthrealmer. Now this spring Gudleik dighted his
ship, being minded to go in the summer east to
Garthrealm. King Olaf sent him word that he would
see him. So when Gudleik came to him the king
told him he wished to be in fellowship with him, and
prayed him to buy him dear havings hard to get
in the land. Gudleik said it should be as the king
would. Then let the king pay him such wealth
as it seemed him good, and Gudleik went into the
Eastways in the summer.</p>

<p>"They lay awhile off Gothland, and here it befell
as oft, that they were not all of them too close
of their words, and the islanders got wind of it that
on board was a chaffering fellow of Olaf the Thick.
Gudleik went into the Eastways in the summer all
the way to Holmgarth (p. <a href="#Page_227">227</a>), and bought there
the cloths full-choice which he was minded for the
king for his robes of state, and therewith furs of great
price and a glorious table-service."</p>

<p>Olaf himself on the way back from Russia to
attempt to recover his kingdom, "hove with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
ships into Gothland where he learnt tidings both
from Sweden and Denmark and all the way from
Norway." A great centre of trade is ever a centre
of news.</p>

<p>Upon the low limestone cliff that is partly enclosed
within the walls of the city and is known as the Klint,
there was of olden time a Vi, or place of sacrifice.
Thus it seems was Visby (or Wisby) named; "by"
is a very common Scandinavian ending that forms
a part of many an English name. Two tiny islets,
very close to the shore, protected the ancient port;
most of it is dry land to-day and what remains wet,
the inner harbour, is so small that an outer harbour
has been formed by a long breakwater. Even this,
however, will admit modern steamers only of the
very smallest draught. From the cruising yachts
landing is only possible in the smoothest weather, and
cargo boats usually call at Slite, a better harboured
place, connected by a narrow-gauged railway with
the capital of the island.</p>

<p>To the person unacquainted with the story of the
North, it will be no small surprise to land on this
remote island and to see a mediæval city that is
almost unrivalled for interest even in the South of
Europe. Here was a chief cradle of the far-told
Hansa League, whose name appears to be derived
from an ancient Gothic word.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The confederation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
for long centuries controlled the shipping and the
commerce of the North, from the Steelyard in London
to Novgorod the Great on the Russian plains; from
Bergen of rockbound Norway to the remotest river-ports
of vineyard-terraced Rhine.</p>

<p>The merchants needed to protect themselves whom
no prince would shield. As with the East India
Company in later years, an association of traffickers
was driven into politics and compelled by circumstances
to make war and peace, and to take up all
the responsibility of a mighty sovereign state. Had
London been further away and the English kings
of feebler frame, the career of the Cinque Ports might
have been very similar. But the sovereigns of
England were deeply interested in all that concerned
their Kent and Sussex harbours, and desired to
utilise their ships. The Holy Roman Emperor at
Aachen was not far off from the teeming Hansa
towns; but, German though he was, his eyes were
fixed on the splendid cities of Italy and the glittering
palaces by the Tiber rather than on the stalwart
shipping of the cities of the North. Had the Emperor
looked north and not south, had the Empire been
German not Roman, the Hansa towns had not played
a greater part in history than did the English Cinque
Ports. Merchants would not have made treaties
nor exercised the prerogatives of princes. But no
German Empire was to arise during mediæval days;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the towns went their own way and refused to do
anything of mark for the Kaiser, who did almost
nothing for them.</p>

<p class="b1">Rapidly waxed the fortunes of the old place of
sacrifice, and during the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries the city had grown to be the Baltic's leading
port. It had become a chief centre of the trade of
Northern Europe and the remotest East, whose
riches were such that an old ballad declares:</p>

<p class="ppn20">With twenty pound weights their gold they weigh,<br />
With costliest jewels as toys they play;<br />
Their swine-troughs are silver, their distaffs are gold,<br />
In Gothland luxurious in wealth untold.</p>

<p class="p1">Visby was declared a Free City by the Emperor
Lothar, the Saxon (1125-37); in 1237, Henry III.
granted its merchants free trade all over England.
So important was British commerce with those
parts that the Easterlings gave to English currency
the name by which (slightly clipped as sterling)
it is known to-day.</p>

<p>Fair churches still attest Visby's devotion, great
walls its military strength. Undefended towns, famed
for their wealth, were almost as unsafe in the early
middle ages as they would be to-day. Visby unwalled
suffered much. In the <i>Saga of Olaf Tryggvison</i> we
read how one of the Earls of Ladir (p. <a href="#Page_69">69</a>), driven
forth by that king, "took such rede that he gat him
a-shipboard and went a-warring to gather wealth
for him and his men. First he made for Gothland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and lay off there long in the summer season, waylaying
ships of chapmen who sailed toward the land, or of
the vikings else; and whiles he went aland and
harried there wide about the borders of the sea."
But at least our fathers had the advantage over
us that in the intervals of all this fighting they did
not need to be practising the oldest of the arts. They
knew not our crushing burdens. The same hands
held the account-book and the sword; the same ships
plowed the sea for trading and for war.</p>

<p>Thus from the turbulence of neighbours the most
peaceful of cities has left us some of the most impressive
examples of military architecture that all Europe
has to show. During the thirteenth century the
burghers walled their town. The defences are of
solid stone and make a bean-shaped circuit of two
miles and a half. For 1,950 yards they run along
the shore, where to-day is the Students' Walk between
the lofty walls and a line of tall trees. The original
height of the walls was fifteen to eighteen feet,
according to the ground. Wide battlements, each
second one pierced by a small embrasure, frowned
along the top and just behind them was the customary
parapet-path, sustained by a series of arches within&mdash;a
very common way of economising materials from
Roman to latest times. Much stronger were the walls
from having two moats towards the land without,
and on the north side there were three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Three older structures&mdash;little towers&mdash;were built
into the walls, and so remain to-day. The Krut
Torn, or Powder Tower, clearly named in later days,
looks over the sea; the Tjärhof, or tar-house, and the
Mynt Hus, look over the land. The tar-house is
clearly known from a use to which it was degradingly
put in latter days. There was a mint at Visby in the
thirteenth century, and there seems to be no evidence
whatever that it was not in this Mynt Hus. Six
towers were also built to strengthen the wall, all
toward the south; one of them is round, established
on a jutting rock. One is known as Kejsar Hus,
or Cæsar's Tower, named evidently because connected
in some way with the Holy Empire of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> For
Roman indeed was the Empire still when these proud
walls rose. As we have already seen, the sovereign
was for ever straining his eyes towards the ancient
city of the Cæsars, there to receive the Imperial
Crown, in Italy to exercise imperial sway.</p>

<p class="b1">A little later in the century, Horace Porter<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> thinks
about the middle, more towers were added and, on
the east, barbicans to enfilade the moats.</p>

<p class="reduct">Of the Churches whose names are in brackets there are now no remains. The spotted area represents

the original harbour was protected. The railway appears in the lower left-hand corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">But all these excellent arrangements for the defence
of the capital did not meet with the approval of the
dwellers in the country round. It would have been
much more remarkable if they had. Those whom
they do not protect can seldom see the point of
fortifications. There is still extant a strong protest
which the villagers of Norfolk made against the
circumvallation of Norwich, England, in 1253. In
1288 the Gothland farmers formed a posse to lay
low the walls of which they disapproved. This
attack was unsuccessful, the peasants were beaten
off, and an appeal was made to the king.</p>

<p>The island had long been Swedish, or rather for a
regular payment it was protected by the Swedish
King. Long, long before, in the ninth century it
seems, the burghers had sent one Avajr Strabajn,
or Longshanks, on a mission to Upsala to make a
treaty with the king. But it is related that the
monarch was sitting at meat in the lofty halls when the
Gothic messenger arrived and, not being in the least
pleased to see him, he kept Longshanks waiting on
the threshold. At length the king unbent so far as
to ask for news of the island, and was told that a
mare had just had three foals. "And what," inquired
the sovereign, "does the third one while the other
two are sucking?" "Just as I am doing," the
ambassador replied, "he stands by and looks on."</p>

<p>Tickled by this neat rebuke to his own execrable
manners, the king invited Longshanks to sit with
him at table, and eventually a treaty was agreed to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
The wealthy islanders supplied money and ships
to the king, and the well-armed monarch promised
to hold out a sword in protection of the commerce
of Gothland.</p>

<p>On this occasion the King of Sweden was entirely
of the same opinion as the peasants about the walls,
but (looking at the matter rather from his own point
of view than from theirs), he decided that the offence
would best be expiated, not by their destruction,
but by a doubled yearly subsidy, with a slight fine
in addition for the presumption of building walls
without the permission of the sovereign lord.</p>

<p>It was very probably during the actual fighting
that those further additions were being made to the
ramparts that cause them to look so impressive to-day.
The walls were heightened and made thicker by
building on the arch-supported walks, or even enclosing
them in new masonry. About forty fresh towers
were added, projecting toward the open country;
some reach the height of seventy feet. Towers
were likewise raised above the gates that were not so
protected before.</p>

<p>Between the great bastions, upon the walls were
perched in many cases bartizans or saddle towers,
projecting on either side, resting on large corbels
built in between the huge battlements of older date;
their outer walls rest upon arches that spring from
corbel to corbel. Within they are open to the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
like the great towers themselves. This is a curious
feature of the work; the floors were all of timber and
to make up for the lost stone walks double timber
galleries ran along the walls within, one above and one
below. The holes for their joists may still be seen,
and ledges in the towers for the floors. All this open
woodwork created a huge danger of fire, especially in
the great towers, and, compared with other mediæval
defences, particularly in France, the ramparts of
Visby give the impression of being the work of
amateurs. Nevertheless, from some points of view,
the combination of low hills and sparkling sea and
lofty towers recalls the mighty walls of the City of
Constantine, whose capture by the Turks in 1453 was
the beginning of the last act in the long mediæval
drama.</p>

<p>Little, however, did these brave defences effect
against the forces of the Danes when in 1361 Visby
was attacked and sacked by Waldemar IV., surnamed
Atterdag, because, if once foiled, he was sure
that his day of success would arrive. Close to the
sea one of the city bastions is known as the Maiden
Tower (Jungfrutornet).<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> There dwelt Nils the goldsmith,
the liar, the loathsome traitor, the hideous
thief. Such language his fellow-townsmen did well
to use if in very truth on account of a petty slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
he suggested the sack of Visby to the robber Danish
king. A young girl, it was fabled, gave Waldemar
information which enabled him to capture the fair
town, and not unfitly she was walled alive into this
very tower, from which circumstance it has its name.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the only real foundation
for these foolish tales was the fact that the
merchants were somewhat ashamed of the very poor
defence they made. Instead of defying the robber
behind their strengthened walls, they abjectly permitted
a breach to be torn when he refused to enter
by a gate.</p>

<p>He had led his army to Gothland and made knights
in that land and struck down many men, for the
peasants were unarmed and unused to war. And he
set his face toward Visby and the citizens came
out and surrendered, for they saw that resistance
was impossible. This we learn from a Franciscan
chronicler of Lübeck, the chief headquarters of the
Hanseatic League.</p>

<p>In the market-place of captured Visby were placed
the three largest vats that in the city could be found,
and these the Danish king insisted should be filled
with glittering gold. The ransom received, the
town was treacherously and pitilessly sacked and the
Danish ships at length sailed off as encumbered with
loot as no doubt the <i>Mayflower</i> was with furniture.
But by far the greater portion&mdash;almost the whole&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
was fated should merely sparkle in the depths of the
tossing sea, for the vessels were wrecked in a fearful
storm and the king came very near being drowned.
Fittingly his body might have lain amidst those ill-gotten
spoils till the day of Holy Doom, but he was
rescued by his men and continued to rule the
Danes.</p>

<p>Not wholly a bad King of Denmark, for he governed
with might and power and in some ways really sought
to enlarge his country's weal. His insult to the
Hansa League was too great even for merchants to
endure, and in striking contrast with the unchivalrous
action of the king, who smote a peaceful city without
excuse, without declaring war, a herald bore to
Waldemar a formal notice that the towns would
fight. Copenhagen was captured and plundered in the
May of 1362, but then the Danes gained a considerable
victory and the beaten burgomaster of proud Lübeck
paid for failure with life.</p>

<p>In 1367 the deputies of seventy-seven towns met
at Köln, and in formal manner confirmed the League
which even then was centuries old. Waldemar contemptuously
likened the citizens to cackling geese,
but ill-founded was his foolish mirth. After a few
years of war, disastrous to the Danes and very profitable
indeed to the traders, he was compelled to sign
the humiliating Treaty of Stralsund, by which he
virtually ceased to be an independent king. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
League took its place as a first-rate power and for
generations dominated the North.</p>

<p>Visby was very fully avenged, but could never
really recover from the staggering blow. The ancient
port now fell on evil days. The city whose maritime
code of laws was to Northern Europe very much what
that of Rhodes was to the Mediterranean, slipped so
low as to be made, helplessly, the headquarters of
Baltic pirates and a pest to the shipping of that sea.
The great Margaret (p. <a href="#Page_120">120</a>) cleared them out and
annexed the island to Denmark,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but her worthless
successor, Eric of Pomerania, erected at the southern
end of the walls the Castle of Visborg,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> to be a stronghold
for himself. The city suffered further from his
blighting presence and piracy sprang up again (p. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>).
The saddest blow fell in the seventeenth century when
the burghers of Lübeck, former sister city and close
ally, plundered and sacked the sinning port and almost
ended its being.</p>

<p>Gradually it shrank to the quiet little market town
that it remains to-day, nestling amid gardens and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
roses and the lofty ruins of its past. But even yet
there is not the sleep of some little English cathedral
towns. The railway runs along the quays by the
harbour, where is sometimes a busy scene. Southward
the chimneys of a factory pour their smoke into
the clear air. The vigorous life of an older day still
stirs in the picturesque market-place by the ruined
Friars' Church. From it wind about to every part
of the city narrow streets between garden walls that
tunnel here and there under the whitewashed houses.</p>

<p>Samuel Laing<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> became quite enthusiastic over the
Visby churches. "These are the most interesting
Gothic edifices in Europe. Wisby is the Rome of the
modern architects who will deal in the Gothic."
Possibly this is exaggerated (Laing's knowledge of
architecture was small), but there is in it an element
of truth. The way in which the church-builders of
Gothland departed from stereotyped principles and
planned as they were moved is refreshingly original.
No series of churches in the world is more deserving
of the closest study. This tendency to unusual ground
plans and the Norwegian stavekirkes are the chief
contributions to Gothic architecture that the northern
lands made as the middle ages wore. It gives a most
vivid idea of the unity of mediæval Christendom
and of the frequency of communication that existed
to realise the way in which architecture went through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the same general course of evolution in all the lands
from Portugal to Norway from the coronation of
Charles the Great to the abdication of Charles V.</p>

<p class="b1">The oldest and most massive of the Visby churches
is dedicated to St. Lars, or Lawrence; it was evidently
raised in the early years of the twelfth century, nine
hundred years after its patron had suffered on the grid.
Though with windows unglazed and bare of any
fittings the structure is very tolerably perfect and, as
one first enters, the effect is exceedingly impressive
and also extremely oriental. Greek merchants raised
it; they had seen Byzantine churches in the East and
desired in the cold North to reproduce their effect.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Only a narrow court separates this church from
another, which a generation later men raised to the
honour of St. Drotten or the Triune God. Some
idle person once invented an absurd tale (reminding
one of that concerning the twin steeples at Ormskirk)
that these sister churches were raised by two rich
sisters who were such bad friends that they would not
even kneel under the same roof to receive the Body
and Blood of Christ. The actual plan is very similar
to that of St. Lars, but it does not seem to have been
so successful.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The Church of St. Olaf (Swedish Olof) appears to
have been of very similar character; there the Norway
merchants used to pray.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The scantiest ruins survive
in the Botanical Gardens. Thither the citizens resort
in summer to eat their meals and listen to a band.</p>

<p>The same plan is reproduced in St. Clemens,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
patron saint has an anchor for his badge and likes his
churches to stand by the sea. The south porch
evidently formed a <i>vapenhus</i>, or house in which
weapons might be left: this was a common feature
of the churches of the North, for thus it is written in
the ancient Icelandic Law Ecclesiastic. "Men shall
not bear weapons in church or oratory that is licensed
for service to be held in, and they shall not set them
against the church gable or the church walls. And
these are reckoned weapons under this head&mdash;axe
and sword and spear and cutlass and halberd."</p>

<p>Excavations within the walls of this now unroofed
shrine, carried on by the learned Dr. Ekhoff, have
exposed foundations of three more ancient churches.
The earliest of them dates back perhaps to about the
year 900 or within a century of the traditional era of
the foundation of the town. A story had grown up
that to St. Olaf was due the first preaching of Christianity
among the merchants of Gothland, but this is
evidently a libel on the progressive thought of the
ancient fathers of the town. The <i>Saga of Olaf</i> has
several visits to Gothland to record, but it says nothing
of his preaching the faith there, and has little of him to
record that would be likely to make the Gothlanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
trow in the same God as he. After the adventure
of Stocksound (p. <a href="#Page_211">211</a>) we learn that "King Olaf sailed
in autumn for Gothland, and arrayed him for harrying
there. But there the Gothlanders had a gathering,
and sent men to the king, and bade him tribute for the
land. To this the king agreed, and took tribute of the
land, and sat there the winter through." It was in
reference to this event that the verse at the head of
the chapter was composed. It was in Gothland too
that Olaf let hew one Jokul, son of Bard, who had
fought against him and was allotted to the steering
of the <i>Bison</i>, which King Olaf himself had owned.</p>

<p>An old story, whether true or not God knows, tells
how in the sixteenth century one digged in this spot
for a more evidently tangible reward. A German
cobbler, Salts Vedel, heard friars or monks in Italy
gossip about the lands from which by the Reformation
they were expelled. "There is buried," said one,
"behind the altar of St. Clemens' Church in Visby a
goose and twenty-four little goslings, and they are all
of solid gold." The cobbler was interested, as well he
might be, and he hastened to the spot. He found the
treasure and it brought no curse. On the contrary
he became powerful and rich, and as Burgomaster
of Visby he died.</p>

<p>The local peculiarity of sustaining the nave vault on
four pillars gained so much favour that it was used
both in the upper and lower stage of the very remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Hospital Church of the Holy Ghost (Helgeands
Kyrkan). Though parts of the quire walling are
evidently earlier, this most striking little sanctuary
seems to date from the early part of the thirteenth
century; the general character is Romanesque, but
early pointed arches and mouldings are employed.
The nave forms an octagonal tower, which formerly
had a gable every side and a low spire rose above. A
particularly pleasing double stair, open by shafted
arcading in the thickness of the western wall, leads up
from the lower to the higher level. The four pillars
below are round, the four pillars above are octagonal,
and in the space between an octagonal opening pierces
through the vault. By two great arches<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> each opens
to the common quire and perhaps women sang above
and men below, so that the opening in the floor
facilitated the blending of voices in the Christian
hymn of praise. The quire itself has the peculiarity
of being apsidal within and square without, and in
the corners of the walls is squeezed a nest of tiny
chambers, miniature stairs connecting those above
and those below.</p>

<p>Apsidal within and square-ended without was likewise
the little church of St. Gertrude the Abbess.
There her countrymen, the merchants from the
Lowlands of Europe, used to make their vows.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<p>Very shallow apses which do not appear without
are to be seen at the ends of the aisles of the great
church of St. Mary, formerly the seat of the Lübeck
merchants and now the cathedral. There was no
such church of old. Though devout men and great
builders of churches, mediæval merchants were not
admirers of bishops, or for that matter of any other
kind of lords. In the Low Countries they contrived
to have only four prelates, in the German commercial
cities extremely few and in Gothland none.
Only as the result of considerable pressure would
the islanders recognise the oversight of the Bishop of
Linköping (Sweden), and he must come with not
more than ten attendants, nor must even so restricted
a train expect to be entertained for more than three
meals.</p>

<p>During the ages of faith there were preserved in this
church, sometimes known as Sancta Maria Teutonicorum,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
the relics of a hero giantess of earliest days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
They were removed soon after 1741, when the great
Linnæus unfeelingly records in his diary: "The Jatta
bones preserved in the church I find, on inspection,
to be those of a whale."</p>

<p class="b1">The two largest of the Visby churches belonged to
Friars, and they alone are normal in ground plan.
Both consist of nave and aisles all of the same height,
with a short quire ending in a buttressed triple apse
projecting from the east; both were Romanesque
altered to the so-called Decorated style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">St. Katarina (Franciscan) stands a roofless ruin
beside the busy market-place; tall octagonal pillars
with moulded caps and bases still sustain arches
running east and west and north and south across the
nave and aisles, dividing the space into rectangles
from which the vaulting has fallen, and wild roses,
growing on the tops of the arches, shower their petals
over the grass-grown floor.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The Dominican church of St. Nicolaus still retains
its massive Romanesque walls in the four west bays,
later openings here and there pierced through. The
rest is of Decorated character, strikingly beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
The great glory of this church was that in days gone
by twin carbuncles glittered in the centres of the brick
rose windows in the western wall. As was fitting
in a church dedicated to the mariners' patron saint,
far out at sea the sailors saw them even when there
were no stars; they lit the night as the sun lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
up the day, nor were their equals to be found in all
the surface of the world. They were not seen within
the church, for the roses do not pierce the wall.
These jewels formed part of the booty of the robber
king.</p>

<p>Without the walls a short distance to the north
stands the roofless church of St. George. This was
not the English chapel, but belonged to an institution
for lepers.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Still further toward the pole the Klint
is washed into steep cliffs by the eternal sea. On this
elevated calvary three stone pillars stand, having
formed the gallows of old. It was a very public
place, commanding wide views over sea and land,
too fair a spot for such a gruesome use.</p>

<p>Not every building of interest in Visby dates from
the time of the city's power, nor even from mediæval
days. The Burmeister House, erected as late as 1662,
displays in its interior paintings covering walls and
ceiling, illustrating Bible stories and depicting other
scenes. It was a rich merchant's house, and the
counter where his customers were served can still be
seen. An interesting witness to the prosperity the
town enjoyed in commerce even at so late a date;
while the present mildness of the climate is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
clear by the great luxuriance of the creepers that
swaddle the whole of the southern end. In no
English cathedral city is any ancient dwelling more
completely buried by vegetation; the windows look
out through fully two feet of insect-sheltering leaves.</p>

<p>Superlatives are always dangerous. There are
much finer buildings and there is far finer scenery
in Europe than anything that Visby has to show.
But the real feature of the place is very much its
own. One meets the influences of many lands.
One beholds an epitome of half the history of the
North. One gets a hint of the architectural features
of remote places of Christendom. Of no town of
equal importance perhaps may the ruins be so pleasantly
surveyed. Midst all the charms of low limestone
hills and peaceful fields by the sea, midst all the
delights of wide gardens fragrant with the scent of
roses, midst all the picturesqueness of a delightful
little country town, may be studied in crumbling
ruin, yet lovingly preserved, the uniquely interesting
churches and stoutly buttressed walls of a city that
once dominated the Mediterranean of the North.</p>

to most of us at least convey no small part of the
pleasure that we derive from the South Downs or
so-called Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>Where the delights of Nature are comparatively
few, on a wide, flat plain, distantly walled by low-looking
hills, there has stood since the very twilight
of Swedish history the town of Upsala&mdash;Lofty Halls.
Of its early days we learn from Snorri Sturluson in
the opening chapters of his great history, called from
its first word, the <i>Heimskringla</i>, "That is the Round
World, whereas manfolk dwell, much sheared apart
by bights so that great seas go from ocean's river far
into the land."</p>

<p>Odin, or Woden, he to whom the fourth day of the
week is hallowed, had led his people from Asgarth
in Asia, and he settled in Sigtown or Sigtuna, on the
lake between Upsala and Stockholm. Only a village
holds the spot to-day with ruined mediæval towers.
"Odin was a great warrior, and exceeding far-travelled,
and had made many realms his own, and so victorious
was he that in every battle he gained the day;
whence it befell, that his men trowed of him that he
should of his own nature ever have the victory in every
battle. His wont it was, if he sent his men to the
wars or on other journeys, before they went to lay his
hands on the heads of them, and to give them blessing,
and they trowed that they would fare well thereby."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
"Odin died in his bed in Sweden; but when he was
come nigh to his death, he let mark him with a spear-point,
and claimed as his own all men dead by weapon;
and he said that he would go his ways to Godhome
and welcome his friends there. Now were the Swedes
minded that he would be come to that Asgarth of old
days, there to live his life for ever; and then began
anew the worship of Odin and the vowing of vows
to him. Oft thought the Swedes that he showed himself
to them in dreams before great battles should be;
and to some he gave victory there and then, and to
others bidding to come to him; and either lot they
deemed good enow." "Now this Sweden they called
Manhome, but Sweden the Great called they Godhome;
and of Godhome are told many tales and
many marvels."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The founder of Upsala was Frey, one of Odin's
<i>Diar</i> or temple-priests, and his successor, next but
one, as king. He "raised a great temple at Upsala,
and there he had his chief abode, and endowed it with
all his wealth, both land and chattels. Then began
the weal of Upsala, which has endured ever since....
Now Frey fell sick, but when his sickness waxed on him
men took counsel and let few folk come in to him;
and they built a great howe (or barrow) and made a
door therein, and three windows; and so when Frey
was dead they bore him privily into the howe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
told the Swedes that he was still alive, and there they
guarded him for three winters, and poured all the
scat (p. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>) into the mound: gold through the one
window, silver through the second, and copper pennies
through the third. And this while endured plenteous
years and peace.... But when all the Swedes wotted
that Frey was dead, and the plenteous years and
good peace still endured, then they trowed that so it
would be while he still abode in Sweden; neither
would they burn him, but called him the God of the
World, and sacrificed to him ever after, most of all
for plenteous years and peace."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>In later chapters we learn that at Upsala was holden
the Thing of all the Swedes. The earth platform on
which they met may still be seen. The place was the
chief town of all the Swede-realm and one of its
monarchs built there a great Hall of the Seven Kings.
"The Upsala kings were the master kings in Sweden,

the time that Odin was lord in Sweden."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Again in the <i>Saga of Olaf the Holy</i> we read: "Tenthland
(p. 185) is the best and most nobly peopled of
Sweden. Thither louteth all the realm. Upsala is
there, with the king's-seat, and there is an archbishop's
chair, and thereby is named the wealth of Upsala.
So call the Swedes the King's-wealth, they call it
Upsala-wealth. In each shire is its own Law-Thing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
its own laws in many matters.... But in all matters
where the laws sunder, they must all yield to the
Upsala-law, and all other lawmen shall be under-men
of the lawman who is of Tenthland."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p class="b1">Three great howes, each rising some fifty-eight
feet above the earthen floor and spreading more than
two hundred feet upon it, are seen from far across
the well-tilled fenceless flats, over which the wind
blows clouds of dust. Many smaller mounds form
a rude crescent stretching across the open plain
with the great hills in the centre. They are doubtless
the last resting-places of many kings about whose
"howing" we read in the sagas. Though of old the
capital of all the land, Upsala is but a tiny village
now, so unimportant that it is known as Gamla (old)
Upsala, for the neighbouring city of Östra-aros
(East mouth), whose cathedral spires are the most
prominent features of the landscape, has usurped the
proper name.</p>

<p class="p1">The Kungshögar or Hills of Kings, as the three great
tumuli have immemorially been called, are distinguished
as those of Odin, Thor and Frey, but these
detail names date from much more recent years.
They were opened, Odin's in 1846, and Thor's in 1874.
They proved to be of the first part of the Later Iron
Age, that is the period just before Viking days.
Each appears to have been piled up over a cairn of
stones covering the ashes of a funeral pyre&mdash;which
is curious in the light of Snorri Sturluson's express
statement:<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> "The first age is called the age of
Burning, whereas the wont was to burn all dead men,
and raise up standing stones to them; but after that
Frey was laid in barrow at Upsala, many great men
fell to raising barrows to the memory of their kin,
no less often than standing stones."</p>

<p>Besides the charred bones of man and horse and
dog, there were many objects for ornament or use,
made of iron and bronze and glass and gold.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> There
was a small cameo of Roman work, carried to these
northern wilds, far beyond the widest limit of imperial
power, not in the wake of all-conquering troops, but
by gainful commerce with barbarian hordes. Or
possibly it was a part of the shameful tribute that
the tottering masters of the world had to offer to
triumphant Goths.</p>

<p>As to the point of burying so much treasure with
the dead we get a useful hint in the <i>Vatzdaela Saga</i>;
a father is expostulating with his son about his lack
of taste for war. "It was the way of mighty kings
or jarls, our peers, that they used to lie out a-warring,
winning themselves riches and glory, and the riches
they won thus were not reckoned in the inheritance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
they left, nor could son take it after father, but
it was laid in howe with themselves. So though their
sons got their lands they could not keep up their
estate, though they inherited the honour, unless they
threw themselves and their men into jeopardy and
warfare; and by this means it was they won riches
and renown one after another, each stepping in the
footprints of his forefathers."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>No spot of earth <i>seems</i> to carry one's mind back so
far into the immemorial past as this. From the top
of one of the great howes we may peer beyond the
history of unnumbered years to the days when
history was not. About the early dawn of man's
activity on earth we may read in any part of the world,
but not in many places may we feel its spell as here.
Close by was the most famous temple in all the
North; and not far off was Odin's grove, whose trees
were the sacredest on earth. And near the temple
grew one tree whose sort might no man know whose
branches were for ever green. The roadway from
the south still approaches the ancient village through
an avenue of rowan or mountain ash. These were
planted recently indeed, but there is the right atmosphere
about the mystic tree whence pagan priests
cut sacred wands; whose wood is still a potent charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and a powerful protection against witchcraft. Just
east of the three great howes we may stand on the
flat-topped Tings-hög, where the ancient assemblies
of Sweden were held and picture the weaponed warriors
not always saying yea to their king. On this
spot, too, we may well wonder why <i>we</i> have abandoned
our excellent northern words, Scandinavian Thing
and Saxon Moot, in favour of a French expression
that only means place where men talk, or a Latin one
that refers to no more than their coming together.
Honey-tasting sparkling mead has here been brewed
through the unnumbered centuries, and we may still
drink from ancient horns what our fathers enjoyed
when the North was first peopled by Aryan
man.</p>

<p>Mead is still brewed indeed, but (happily) not in such
noble quantity as was the case of old. "There was
a great homestead," we read in the sagas, "and
therein was there wrought a mighty vat many ells
high, which stood on mighty big beams; now this
stood down in a certain undercroft, and there was a
loft above it, the floor whereof was open, that the
liquor might be poured down thereby; but the vat
was full of mingled mead, and the drink was wondrous
strong." Unfortunately the king, a mighty
man whose years were full of plenty and peace,
was staying with the owner and went out amidst the
night, when, being bewildered with sleep and dead-drunk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
he missed his footing, fell into the mead-vat
and was lost there.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>In the temple festivals were held at Yule and twice
besides in every year. One was the thanksgiving
for good crops that the New England Puritans unconsciously
revived. And greater feasts took place as
often as the ninth year came. Mighty sacrifices
were offered to the Gods and the victims were human
at times. As in Mexico and elsewhere, highest
reverence was paid to these unhappy men between
dedication and death. The worship on the whole
was of the beastliest; the temple and the grove
must frequently have resembled blood-reeking shambles
and there was nothing to regret when the people
began to trow in the faith of the White Christ. The
beauty of building and stateliness of ritual that characterised
the shrines of Buddhist India or of Egypt or of
Greece were but faintly reflected in the rude and
untaught North.</p>

<p>In the days of King Domald there fell on the
Swedes great hunger and famine. So they offered
oxen with no result; next year "they offered men,
and the increase of the year was the same, or worse
it might be, but the third autumn came the Swedes
flockmeal to Upsala whenas the sacrifices should be.
Then held the great men counsel together, and were
of one accord that this scarcity was because of Domald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
their king, and withal that they should sacrifice him
for the plenty of the year; yea, that they should set
on him and slay him, and redden the seats of the Gods
with the blood of him; and even so they did."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
So successful was this service that there was good
plenty and peace throughout the days of his son's
long reign, "of him is nought more told save that
he died in his bed at Upsala."</p>

<p>A later king named Aun gained length of days by
offering up his sons, for Odin had made him the
promise that he should live on for ever, even so long
as he gave Odin one of his sons every tenth year.
"So when he had offered up seven sons, then he lived
ten winters yet in such case that he might not go
afoot, but was borne about on a chair. Then he
offered up yet again the eighth son of his, and lived
ten winters yet, and then lay bedridden. Then he
offered up his ninth son, and lived ten winters yet,
and then must needs drink from a horn, even as a
swaddling babe. Now had he one son yet left, and
him also would he offer up, and give to Odin
Upsala withal and the countryside thereabout,
and let call it Tenthland (p. <a href="#Page_179">179</a>)<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>; but the Swedes
forbade it him, and there was no sacrifice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
So King Aun died, and was laid in howe at
Upsala."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The zeal of Iceland has indeed clothed these earthen
mounds with vigorous life, this spot with vivid story.
So much so that they are hardly to be called prehistoric,
however the word may spring to our lips
from the study of such earth monuments in other
lands.</p>

<p>It is tradition&mdash;but probably untrue&mdash;that there
still stand parts of the ancient temple which glittered
with gold in every corner, where were figures of Thor,
of Odin and of Frey, the God of Thunder, most
honoured, in the midst; so Adam of Bremen says.
Chains of gold clinked on the temple roof, as chains
of baser metal hang on many a Russian church to-day.
A square, stone pile, of massive work but rude, stands
high above the plain: two gateways toward the
north, two toward the south, and two toward the
west, only toward the east but one. It seems more
likely, notwithstanding, that this gable-roofed structure
was always what it is to-day, the central tower of
a cruciform church, round-arched in style, opening
to transepts and nave by two arches, but to the quire
by only one.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>That the church which was built by King Sverker I.
in 1138<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> has annexed both the site and the materials
of the temple of the Three Gods we need not doubt,
but the structure is a fairly ordinary Romanesque
building exactly suiting the architecture of the age.
The small chancel of three bays has a round apse and
round-headed windows, and if the plan preserved in
the vestry&mdash;here reproduced&mdash;be founded on fact,
there were once apsidal transepts, and an aisled nave
that was not in line, but swerved away to the north.
Built into the south wall of the apse is a Runic stone&mdash;here
sketched&mdash;put up to the memory of his father
by Sigvid, who had fared to England and come safely
back.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> (See page <a href="#Page_108">108</a>.)</p>

<p>Eric IX. (p. <a href="#Page_192">192</a>) is traditionally connected with the
building of the church. Perhaps to him are owed the
plain ribbed vaults, indicated on the plan by dotted
lines. In life he was known as Log-gifware, or Giver
of Laws, and every one of his statutes were good; after
death he was known as saint. With the first primate
of Upsala, St. Henry, a man of English birth, Eric
conquered the Finns, and, as this was an attack on one
of the last centres of heathenism in Europe, it ranked
as a crusade. The Swedish saint mourned to see so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
many pagans slain without a chance of Heaven, but
the English saint was made of sterner stuff and he
refused to weep. All heathen were vermin to him.</p>

<p>He met his end in a most un-English way. The
mistress of a house had expressly refused to invite him
to her board, but all the same he went. In that rude
age the conventions of society had not yet been elaborated,
and so, instead of welcoming him with their lips
and fuming in their hearts, the owners of the house
sent the unbidden guest into another world (see p. <a href="#Page_213">213</a>).
Nevertheless in Finland he was highly honoured by the
sword-established Church; the cathedral at the old
capital of Abo bears his name and once enshrined his
remains. But in later days (by Count Douglas, p.
238) they were carried in triumph to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Three miles of level plain, still fertile, for the soil is
unexhausted by the tillage of two thousand years,
separates Old Upsala from the town of Östra-aros,
which usurped both the name and the archbishopric
in 1276. From a distance its buildings seem to rise
from the very forests in true Swedish style, but when
the streets are gained one is somewhat reminded of
Holland. For long rows of trees, largely lime and
horse-chestnut, border the little (river) Fyrisa, which
flows unhasting to the northern end of Mälar, and on
the banks are a few picturesque gabled houses with
seventeenth century dates. Trees line many of the
wide streets and partly hide the trolley trams. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
great brick cathedral in the distance too has a certain
Flemish look. But all idea of Holland is expelled
by the massive unbeautiful castle standing high on its
wooded cliffs.</p>

<p>This city seems to have a character all its own,
largely through mingling the features of many other
towns. Here in the wooded Swedish plain an English
close, a Dutch canal and an American campus seem
somehow or other to have met. The interest of the
place centres largely round the university, which has
sheltered no small number of scholars that the whole
world holds great.</p>

<p class="b1">In Upsala one is vaguely conscious of the existence
of that intense charm, all-pervading yet undefinable,
that in Oxford and Cambridge is so helped by the
presence of buildings unrivalled on earth. Here no
crumbling, creeper-covered walls surround garden
quadrangles, nor do elm-shaded lawns slope to a
placid river; here are none of the towers and spires
of Isis, nor the deep red Tudor brickwork towers of
Cam. The university was only founded in 1477 by
the national leader, Sten Sture the Elder, who had
been chosen administrator of Sweden at the Diet of
Arboga six years before. It possesses no buildings
that in themselves would claim attention for half an
hour, though many are attractive from the well-treed
lawns on which they stand. The oldest is called from
the hero king who raised it, the Gustavianum; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a plain white structure over which rises a tower capped
by a swelling dome that displays the influence of the
East. The new building, finished in 1886, has a fine
central corridor panelled in green marble, and over the
door of the Aula is written (from Thorild) in letters of
gold:</p>

<p class="ppn20">Great to think free,<br />
But greater to think right.</p>

<p class="p1">One feels the same atmosphere of culture and of
high ideal, of youthful enthusiasm and of joy that
makes the two older universities of England so lovable,
though it is produced with so much simpler scenes.</p>

<p>The ungowned, white-capped students,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> some two
thousand of them, delighting in music and serenades,
are organised in thirteen "nations." These somewhat
recall English colleges, for they have buildings
of their own, and somewhat resemble American Greek
letter fraternities, but such likenesses soon leave off
and wide differences appear. The members of the
nations are chosen by the accident of birth, for each
includes the students from one or more of the Swedish
"läns." Graduating ceremonies take place in the
cathedral, for, as in Oxford and Cambridge, the
university is connected with the church.</p>

<p>The university library is not in the least architecturally
striking, but among its somewhat numerous
treasures is the famous <i>Codex Argenteus</i>, written on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
purple parchment in uncial letters of silver and gold.
It was captured at Prague in 1648 and, as it gives us
the text of Ulfilas' Gothic Bible, no more appropriate
home for it could have been found in the wide world.</p>

<p>In the chief square of Upsala is a statue (by
Börjeson) of one of the most renowned of former
professors, Eric Gustaf Geiger (1783-1847), the poet
who with zeal and zest sought to restore respect for
native traditions so long overlaid by fads from France
during Gustavian times. This he took up so seriously
that thus, during his very engagement, wrote his
future wife to a friend. Geiger "has become a Goth;
instead of loving me he is in love with Valkyries and
shield-bearing maidens, drinks out of Viking horns,
and carries out Viking expeditions&mdash;to the nearest
tavern. He writes poems which must not be read in
the dark, they are so full of murders and deeds of
slaughter." This is putting it somewhat crudely, the
movement on the whole was very good. It is far
better that each nation should cultivate and develop
the traditions of its own fathers&mdash;if any such there be&mdash;rather
than seek to copy ready-made the conclusions
of another folk. And Sweden has no need to learn
from France.</p>

<p>Geiger's daughter married the Count Hamilton who
was Governor of Upsala during the visit of Du Chaillu
(p. 223) and entertained the explorer in the castle.
The Swedish branch of this great Scottish house is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
descended from two brothers who, like many other
Britishers, offered their swords to Gustavus Adolphus
in 1624. Of the mediæval castle extremely slight
ruins are to be seen; the present heavy and unfinished
round-towered mansion was erected by Gustaf Vasa.
In it took place the picturesque but humiliating
ceremony of Christina's abdication of the throne, to
shake the earth of Sweden from her feet and to amuse
herself idly among peoples and courts further south.
The best thing about the castle is the superb view
from its windows over the forest town.</p>

<p>The Botanical Gardens were set out by Linnæus
himself, rather for serious study than for display of
flowers. The founder of modern botany, to whom
there is a marble statue by Byström, became a professor
at Upsala in 1741 and was laid to rest in one of
the chapels of the cathedral during 1778.</p>

<p>Close to the banks of the river is the Erikskälla,
marking the spot where Eric fell, national saint of
Swedes (p. <a href="#Page_187">187</a>). He was canonised by the Swedish
Church, not known at Rome, for the rival house of
Sverker had gotten the ear of the pope. A spring has
burst forth from the soil; such a thing very frequently
happens where a saint has breathed his last. The story
of his life is portrayed by mural paintings in one of
the apsidal chapels on the south of the cathedral, the
only part of the building where the brick vaulting-ribs
are left exposed. He was at service in the Bondkyrka,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
or peasants' church, of the Trinity,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> when
the Danes made a surprise attack. The devout king
refused to leave till the service came to an end, but
soon after, fighting bravely at the head of his men, he
was cut down by victorious foes.</p>

<p>His silver-gilt shrine is still the chief treasure of the
noble cathedral that rose between Trinity Church and
St. Eric's Spring when the archbishopric was moved
from the old Upsala to the new. This great church
would dominate a much larger town, for its twin spires
rise but little short of four hundred feet. It was
designed by one of the builders of Notre Dame, Etienne
de Bonneuil, who by a document written in Paris on
September 8, 1287, was appointed master builder of
Sweden's new metropolitan church. By students
from Scandinavia at the French capital the cathedral
rising by the Seine was so much admired that they
got it arranged that a "tailleur de pierre" from its
works should reproduce its glories among the forests
of the North. It is thus no surprise to find the plan
of Upsala Cathedral reproducing that of Notre Dame,
though much simplified and on a scale considerably
reduced.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The superficial resemblance is by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
close, for the materials available were only brick with
stone for necessary detail work, which had to be
sparingly used.</p>

<p>The great rose windows, west and north, the
clustered piers and moulded arches, the plainly ribbed
vaulting and indeed the general effect of the interior
remind one of the fairest contemporary churches of
France, but the blind storey (or triforium), pierced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
only by meaningless little circles, does nothing to
recall the beautiful arcades that open to the galleries
of Notre Dame, while the plain pinnacles and flying
buttresses without are destitute of any substitutes for
the world-famed devils that look down on the Paris
streets.</p>

<p>The oldest monument is a brass memorial to Birger
Persson, who was president of the Royal Commission
which codified the laws of Upland in 1296. One of
the children figured afterwards became the illustrious
St. Birgitta, or Brita, who, after the death of her
husband Ulf, visited Jerusalem, received revelations,
founded an order for monks and nuns, and took a
prominent part in Church affairs at Rome, trying to
get the pope back from Avignon. Her revelations,
or some of them, have been printed, but, if one may
judge by the samples read by Bishop Wordsworth,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
they are somewhat sorry stuff, not superior to the
sermons of an average curate and not to be compared
with the revelations of St. Julian of Norwich.</p>

<p>The rules of her order were revealed to her (so she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
firmly believed) by Christ, and approved by the pope.
There was a house in England (the priory of Syon),
while the principal convent of the Order of the Holy
Saviour, as it was called, stood on Lake Vettern at
Vadstena; its buildings to-day form a refuge for the
mad. In the church the relics of the foundress are
still reverently preserved, for Charles XII. refused to
sell them to the pope. "First and foremost," he
remarked, "no one can say for certain if they be her
bones or not; secondly, in no wise would I be a party
to the encouragement of idle superstition; and
thirdly I am not a dealer in old bones."</p>

<p>In 1590 papal envoys had purchased the relics of
another Swedish saint named David, who hung his
gloves on sunbeams, and the church at Munketorp
was built with the price they paid; but the priest
who effected the sale boasted at a synod that he had
only given up the first skeleton that he found in the
vaults of the church.</p>

<p>St. Brita has taken a strong hold on popular imagination
in Sweden and figures largely in the folklore
of the land. Her peculiar sanctity it is said enabled
her to see the devil, until one day she failed to control
her laughter when in church she saw him bump his
head against a pillar. He was trying to stretch a
goat's skin with his teeth, for as it was the vellum
was far too small to hold the names of those that
he noticed nodding as the sermon wore. The local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
colour of this tale seems distinctly later than the
fourteenth century, when St. Brita was alive.</p>

<p>In the Lady Chapel of the cathedral is a fine
monument to Gustaf Vasa with effigies in English
alabaster of the king and two wives. The walls are
painted with some of the events of his adventurous
life.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Restored to his birth-land in 1908 and deposited in
this cathedral after original burial in England during
1772, are the bones of one of the strangest characters
that Sweden ever produced, Emanuel Swedenborg.
Son of a distinguished bishop, he early made a name
as a scientist and his achievements were of no mean
kind. He anticipated modern knowledge as to the
planets of the solar system flying off from the mass
of the sun and developing their own orbits and rotations.
In England he knew Newton, Halley and
Flamsteed, and on the Continent also he met the chief
men of science of his day. Great practical assistance
in the engineering line he was able to afford to Charles
XII., including help in the construction of docks at
Karlskrona (p. <a href="#Page_164">164</a>), and the transport of ships overland
in the war against Norway in 1718. During the
latter part of his life Swedenborg had visions and
founded in London the <i>Society of the New Church
signified by the New Jerusalem</i>, his ideas being much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
influenced by Gnosticism. How far he was qualified
as a religious teacher is of course a matter of opinion.
Emerson says that he is "disagreeably wise, and with
all his accumulated gifts paralyses and repels."</p>

<p>Few spots of Europe surpass in interest these
simple and unornamented monuments of all the ages
of the northern world: earth mounds told of in saga
story, cathedral carrying the loveliest style of central
Europe to the far North, castle where kings dwelt of
old, university that has influenced the thought of
all mankind. Though the capital is moved to the
outlet of the lake, where there rises a yet fairer town,
this plain is the true centre of Swedish story from
earliest to latest days.</p>

<p class="ppn20"><a name="Here" id="Here">Here</a> the dark woods, with many a patriarch tree,<br />
In gloomy melancholy gaze on thee;<br />

Seem the vast structure of some giant's hand;<br />

<p class="pn p2">One must be feeling in a particularly happy frame of
mind not to be conscious of a certain depression when
approaching London from almost any side. Nearly
all large cities have to a greater or less extent transformed
and half spoilt their surroundings.</p>

<p>Stockholm has done nothing of the sort and there
lies its unique charm. A vast city of more than a
quarter of a million souls rises straight from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
primeval forest and clear blue water. The Swedish
capital reposes on islands and spreads to the mainland
north and south, surrounded by the woods and the
lakes. Westward to the Cattegat is a shipway,
hollowed partly by the spade of man and partly by the
tooth of time; northward stretches a natural waterway
to the ancient capital of Lofty Halls. And the
winding fjord that leads up from the open sea, through
which the great lake drains, is of wonderful beauty.
Low rocky shores, island and mainland, spruce woods
close to the water, recall the loveliest scenery of the
New England lakes, but there is the added charm
of heather wherever the trees leave room.</p>

<p>Small steamers lie in little coves so near the rockbound
shore that it almost seems their rigging is likely
to get tangled among boughs of oak, and their crews
can pick wild strawberries the moment they step on
land. For a mile or two the channel from the Baltic
to Stockholm is most intricate and extremely narrow,
then great lake-like expanses are traversed before
the vessel enters another narrow gate. Little painted
houses dot the woods, but they are few. The general
effect of the constantly shifting shores is of almost
fairy-like beauty, especially with the peculiarly Scandinavian
interlocking of the water and the land.</p>

<p>At length across a stretch of island-dotted lake
the spires and roofs of the capital seem to rise right
out of the woods. Eventually one lands in the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
middle of the town. The whole place is intensely
modern, the metropolis of a most progressive folk.
Large numbers of Stockholmers dwell in flats despite
their love of flowers. One of the chief landmarks of
the city is the tall network tower of iron bars that surmounts
the telephone centre. This repose-disturbing,
but extremely useful, invention has fascinated the
Swedes. The charges are extremely low, and Stockholm
actually boasts of having more telephone
numbers than New York.</p>

<p>The first impression is that of a distinctly striking
town; the vast Royal Palace and the huge Northern
Museum produce a very individual effect, though
hardly perhaps one that can be called monumental.
All the conspicuous buildings are in some variety of
the Classic style, several erected during the last few
years. The streets are broad, but geography forbids
any great regularity, excepting to the north and south.
All roads lead to the water, except a few that lead to
the woods; the chief ones pass through wide squares
and parks. Immensely improved is the city since 1847,
when an English traveller wrote: "The natural
advantages of approach are not adequately appreciated,
or rather done justice to by the Swedes. Their
whole style of architecture is mean to a degree; and
their houses on each side of the Mälar quite unworthy
that superb piece of water. With a few of the old
palaces of Venice on each bank, and trees at intervals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and a gondola or two afloat, the northern capital, from
its more romantic environs, would far exceed the
other."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The site indeed is almost unexcelled. So far as
natural beauty goes, the owners of these nine bridge-linked
islands<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> need not envy the dwellers on the
Seven Hills. From the narrows that the islands guard
broad waters spread far on almost every side; Lake
Mälar ripples gently for nearly eighty miles toward
the west, splashing towns and villages and rocks and
woods, and pours its broad waters swiftly past the
islands toward the sea. Ocean steamers are moored
by the wide busy quays of the prosperous city: small
steamboats supplement the trolley trams to provide
communications for the town. Toward the interior
four lines of railway thread their way among the farms
and the woods. For the vast silent forests of the
North touch the immediate outskirts of the town;
and trees are planted wherever the streets leave a
small space unused.</p>

<p>By far the most conspicuous building, weirdly
attractive by its complete incongruity with its surroundings,
is the immense Royal Palace, a magnific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
pile in the heaviest French Classic style, whose
rectangular courtyard is enclosed by a block measuring
no less than 408 by 381 feet, and rising in three
storeys to a height of nearly a hundred feet. These
ample dimensions are increased by wings of about
half the elevation projecting eastward toward the
water front, and by another on the west that greatly
lengthens the north façade. This structure, whose
simplicity and grandeur made an impression on
Fergusson, occupies quite a considerable portion of
the original island of Staden.</p>

<p>The architect was a Frenchman, Nicodemus de
Tessin, and so much impressed with the designs was
Louis XIV. that he specially congratulated his Swedish
brother on the magnificent edifice he was proposing
to erect. This king had planned to incorporate part
of an older building on the site, but a fire which
occurred while he was himself lying-in-state in the
unfinished structure nearly cremated the body of the
monarch and quite gave the architect complete liberty
of design. The present building was begun by the
renowned Charles XII. on his accession in 1697, and,
much delayed by war and turmoil, its erection dragged
on till 1760. For a wonder the later architects
employed, including De Tessin's son, resisted the
temptation to modify the plans.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Simplicity is by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
far the chief merit of the palace, only in the centre of
each side are pilasters introduced; the top is finished
with the plainest cornice and balustrade and the sky
line is as horizontal as that of the sea.</p>

<p>The building made a great impression in Europe
when it was erected, and several travellers speak of it
in terms of rather exaggerated praise. Thus Laing,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
himself a Scot, after a very appreciative description,
exclaims, "What are our public buildings about
Edinburgh, our churches, hospitals, squares, street-fronts,
with all their pillars, porticos, pilasters, cornices
and carved work, compared to the composition and
effect of this chaste and grand building?&mdash;minced
pies, pastry-cook work in freestone." The only
really serious defect is that the design is not adapted
to the site and the material is not adapted to the
design. Such a structure requires a vast space all
round and looks cramped on a small island; it needs
material of the most substantial, set off by avenues of
trees and formal gardens on a lavish scale, but amid
the rocks of Stockholm it is plastered and in the City
of Flowers its immediate environs are comparatively
destitute of vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same general style as the palace and close
to it are other public buildings, but unfortunately
the topography of the islands forbids their forming
parts of a single great design. The beautiful Riddarhus,
or Hall of Knights, the headquarters of the
Swedish nobles in the capital, is a seventeenth century
structure of brick and stone, designed by Simon de la
Vallée, adorned with Corinthian pilasters and floral
bands between the storeys. The Riksdaghuset, or
Houses of Parliament, recently erected, form a fine
block of red granite buildings that rather crush the
little island of the Holy Ghost, on which they stand.
The two upper storeys have Corinthian columns or
pilasters and the sky-line is broken by sculpture rising
over the balustrade. Both chambers are octagonal,
and their members, for whom women vote, reach them
by a most striking stairway, excellently adorned with
marble, mottled, white and green. (See <a href="#Here">chapter-heading</a>.)</p>

<p>Close to the palace, looking over the harbour, is a
very impressive statue of Gustavus III.; it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
work of J. T. Sergel, second only to Thorwaldsen
among the sculptors of the North. Brilliantly this
charmer king, this monarch of the double face,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
taught Sweden to sin, fatuously he sought to bring
to the icy pine-woods of the North the tinsel trinkets
of Versailles. The country did not prosper, the royal
house was undermined, the king was murdered, and
soon a brave French soldier came to restore vigour
and virtue to the long-suffering land.</p>

<p class="b1">Still the reign that gave to Sweden Karl Mikael
Bellman, the poet, and other illustrious men was by
no means altogether barren of good results. The old
French culture introduced is very far from being lost,
and the Swedish Academy, which Gustavus founded
in 1786, is one of a number of learned societies that
have their homes in this city and have done much to
make the Swedish capital pre-eminent for its devotion
for letters. Another is the Academy of Sciences,
in whose institution the great Linnæus had no small
share. Many of their members have a reputation
Europe-wide. Lost now is the position to which
Sweden once attained, chief military power in the
North, but higher her place in the world. The
sword-won dominion of Gustavus Adolphus could not
endure for very long&mdash;geography forbade&mdash;but a
nobler Swedish empire was founded, or at any rate
consolidated, by the genius of Linnæus, and that
shows no sign of decay. There will dawn a day
when mere brute force will no longer be the test of a
nation's weal, but in Europe it is hardly yet.</p>

<p class="p1">Across a monumental bridge, adorned with statues
and lamps, on the island of Djurgarden, stands a
recently finished structure of Renaissance character
which looks like a great cruciform church, but is in
fact the Northern, or the Folk, Museum. The great
hall contains figures in armour, old coaches and
such like to illustrate days that are past, but more
interesting are the little chambers that show us in
detail the life of Sweden in bygone years. Within
an old cottage we see a duck-coop under the sofa and
shut-up cupboards against the walls. Carved chests
and spinning wheels and lace and little looms and
fishing implements and traps for bears, saddles and
flutes and harps and drums give the attentive student
a very fair idea of how the peasants used to pass their
days. No servile breed these men who crushed the
armies of the Empire in the war of Thirty Years and
first subdued the woods by the Delaware.</p>

<p>A story told by W. W. Thomas<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> is fairly characteristic
of the stern and independent nature of the
farmers who have made Sweden.</p>

<p>"A Swedish peasant, clad in homespun and driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a rough farm wagon, pulled up at a post station in the
west of Sweden. There were but two horses left in
the stable, and these he immediately ordered to be
harnessed into his wagon. Just as they were being
hitched up, there rattled into the courtyard in great
style the grand equipage of the governor of the
province, with coachman and footman in livery.
Learning the state of affairs and wishing to avoid a
long and weary delay, the coachman ordered these
two horses to be taken from the peasant's cart and
harnessed into the governor's carriage. But the
peasant stoutly refused to allow this to be done.</p>

<p>"'What,' said the governor, 'do you refuse to
permit those horses to be harnessed into my
carriage?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, I do,' said the peasant.</p>

<p>"'And do you know who I am?' said the governor,
somewhat in a rage. 'I am the governor of this province,
a knight of the Royal Order of the Northern
Star, and one of the chamberlains of His Majesty the
King.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, ho!' said the peasant. 'And do you, sir,
know who I am?'</p>

<p>"He said this in such a bold and defiant manner
that the governor was somewhat taken aback. He
began to think that the fellow might be some great
personage after all&mdash;some prince, perhaps, travelling
in disguise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"'No,'he said, in an irresolute voice, 'I do not
know who you are. Who are you?'</p>

<p>"'Well,' replied the peasant, walking up to his
face and looking him firmly in the eye, 'I'll tell you
who I am&mdash;I am the man that ordered those horses.'</p>

<p>"After this there was nothing more to be said.
The peasant quietly drove away on his journey, and
the governor waited until such time as he could
legally procure fresh means of locomotion."</p>

<p>Along the "clearstorey" of the church-like museum
are a series of little chambers fitted and furnished to
illustrate the life of the middle classes from 1520 to
the end of the nineteenth century. These are far
less distinctively Swedish than the objects taken
from cottages.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>So modern is Stockholm, bustling capital of a
great industrial nation, so entirely Classic its principal
buildings, that it seems almost incongruous that it
should be a town of great historic interest, whose
story goes back to saga days. The site is heard of now
and then in the very earliest annals of the North.</p>

<p>Once a king of Upsala is fabled here to have celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
his marriage and gotten his bane. Round his
neck he wore a great gold chain that his sires had worn
of yore. He desired to wed the lovely Skialf, whose
father, a monarch further east, he had just conquered
and slain in war. She only bargained that a
funeral feast for her parent might decorously precede
the marriage feast for herself. The king of Upsala
and his warriors poured down the grave-ale right
heartily so that they could not stand. The bride and
her friends had only feigned to drink so that they
were in better condition for action when the feast
was done. They contrived to slip one end of a rope
through the great gold chain and the other end over the
bough of a large oak. Thus the monarch of Upsala
was hung and the bride unwed sailed home.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Within the present limits of Stockholm too, Olaf
the Holy as a precocious viking youth showed some
of that astuteness that was with him all through life.
He had been harrying in the neighbourhood of
Sigtuna, much to the annoyance of the Swedes, and
"when autumn set in Olaf Haraldson got to know that
Olaf the Swede-king drew together a great host, and
also that he had done chains athwart Stocksound, and
set guard thereover. But the Swede-king was of
mind that King Olaf would there bide the frosts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
he held Olaf's host of little worth, for he had but a
small company. So King Olaf went out to Stocksound,
and might not get through there, for a castle
was on the west side of the sound and a host of men
on the south. But when they heard that the Swede-king
was gone aboard ship, and had a great host
and a multitude of ships, King Olaf let dig a dyke
through Agni's-thwaite into the sea. At this time
great rains prevailed.</p>

<p>"Now from all Sweden every running water falls
into the Low, and out to sea there is one oyce from
the Low, so narrow that many rivers be wider. But
when great rains or snow-thaws prevail, the waters
fall with such a rush that through Stocksound the
water runs in a force, and the Low goes so much upon
the lands that wide-about be floods. Now when
the dyke got to the sea, then leapt out the water and
the stream. Then King Olaf let take inboard all the
rudders of his ships, and hoist all sails topmast high.
And there was a high wind at will blowing. They
steered with the oars, and the ships went apace out
over the shoal, and came all whole into the sea.</p>

<p>"Then the Swedes went to see Olaf the Swede-king,
and told him that by then Olaf the Thick had
got him away out into the sea. So the Swede-king
rated soundly those who should have watched that
Olaf gat not away."</p>

<p>The fact that the sagas give the place (or neighbourhood)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the only distinctive part of the present
name makes somewhat superfluous the legends that
have grown up to account for the designation Stockholm.
One of these declares that in the twelfth
century by robber bands the ancient capital of Sigtuna
had been destroyed. So placing their remaining
valuables in a dug-out stock, the surviving
citizens committed it to the waters of the lake and
followed in their boats the drifting log. At the island
where at last their stock came to shore the future
capital rose.</p>

<p>But the true founder of Stockholm was stout Birger
Jarl, of royal race, and father of kings, who ruled the
land (as regent for his son) from 1251 till his death in
1266.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> He desired to lock the Mälar with a fortress
town, and the advantages of doing this were so great
that we may safely reject the idle tale that he too
cast a log into the lake and vowed to build the town
wherever the waters cast it up. Many a legend has
grown to account for a city's name, but men of the
stamp of Birger Jarl know what they want too well
to trust to the decision of the winds. The new town
rapidly grew in importance and from its splendid
position gradually became the capital of the country.</p>

<p>Gone are the winding lanes of mediæval days, gone
are all traces of the city's youth except a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
churches. A son of Birger Jarl, Magnus Ladulaas,
who reigned from 1279 till 1290, founded a Franciscan
convent and placed it on Riddarsholm, the island of
the Knights. His surname, which signifies the locker
of barns, was gained by a most just law he made
compelling nobles like common folk to pay for any
corn or straw that they might require on travels.
"No Roman Emperor," gratefully exclaims the old
<i>Swedish Chronicle</i>, "could wish himself a nobler
name that Ladulaas, and very few could have laid
claim to it, for the name of Ladu-brott (barn-breaker)
would suit most rulers much better."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>It is sad to know that this evil custom, the right
to demand hospitality from unwilling hosts, was
founded&mdash;largely at any rate&mdash;by an Englishman and
a saint (p. <a href="#Page_188">188</a>). Other natives of the British Isles
than he have bitterly complained of Continental
inns. Henry had a practical remedy; he instituted
the custom, that was sure to be abused, of making
every peasant's house a free hostelry for travellers
of note.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The ancient church of the Franciscans (now known
as the Riddarsholms-Kyrka) is a brick structure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
early fourteenth century, raised a few years after the
convent was founded; it is not greatly impressive.
Nave of five bays, quire of three, triple apse to the
east, clumsy-looking tower to the west. Round pillars
hold up a heavy vault, whitewash daubed, and, as is
so commonly the case in Scandinavia, unrelieved
by any clearstorey. On to the tower has been hoisted
a cast iron spire that rises 290 feet into the clear air
and looks as awkward and unhappy as the similar
feature over the cathedral at Rouen. The great
interest of the church is that it has become the
valhalla of warrior, sage and king; the floor is laid
in gravestones, the walls blaze with the painted arms
of the Knights of the Seraphim Order, the air is thick
with the banners that Swedes have won in war. In
the quire is the effigy of the founder, but as space in
the church was small classic chapels have been added
both north and south to be the last resting-places of
other of Sweden's honoured dead. On the sun-warmed
side of the quire a chapel bears date 1633, and its
rather indifferent architecture is forgotten from the
fact that it contains, within a later sarcophagus of
green marble, the ashes of Gustavus Adolphus, one
of the noblest of mankind, the hero king who perished
victorious on the field of Lützen (1632).</p>

<p>Opposite on the north is the Carolinian chapel,
a domed Classic structure with detached columns
outside where rest the renowned twelfth Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and other princes of the Vasa House. Another
chapel bears the name of Bernadotte, founder of the
ruling line.</p>

<p>It was before the altar of this church during the
fourteenth century that the arrogant noble, Bo
Jonsson, called Grip, because his arms were a griffin's
head, who "ruled the land with a glance of his eye,"<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
uncontrolled by the helpless king, hewed in pieces
his foe Karl Nilsson, and was never called to account
on this side of the veil. Here, too, among the dead
in later days, far into the night mused the third
Gustavus, hoping to receive some omen from his
fathers' graves.</p>

<p>It is rather misleading to call this comparatively
humble shrine the Westminster Abbey of the land
that holds the Cathedral of Upsala and so many
other glorious fanes. Instead of one of the grandest
minsters on the earth, echoing several times a day
with Christian praise, it is a somewhat commonplace
church whose silence is broken only by the chatter
of tourists, save on the anniversary of some hero's
death or when another monarch has entered upon his
last sleep. Nevertheless there is a deep and haunting
interest in this last earthly resting-place of so many
who have helped to shape the world.</p>

<p>Close to this church is a fine statue by Fogelberg
to Birger Jarl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">The Storkyrka, or great church of St. Nicholas,
has been Classicised without. It is better so, for
with the great palace forcing Classic standards on the
city, Gothic must look out of place, however much
better its general lines would have suited the untamed
site and the ancient traditions of Stockholm. Pastor
here 1543-52 was the famous Olavus Petri<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> who,
with his brother, Laurentius, Archbishop of Upsala,
did much to shape the Swedish Reformation. Messenius'
<i>Rhyme-Chronicle</i> tells us:</p>

<p class="ppn20">On Master Olof's wedding day<br />
Our Lutherdom had made such way<br />
That mass in Swedish first was sung.<br />
So all men followed their own tongue.<br />
For so had Master Olof seen<br />
How things at Wittenberg had been;<br />
There first at Carlstadt's marriage feast<br />
Was German mass sung by a priest.</p>

<p class="p1">Chancellor of the kingdom he had been in earlier
days (1532), but so much of an idealist was Olof that
he desired public penance to be exacted from all
who complained of the weather! This did not suit
the sternly practical king, Gustaf Vasa, who dismissed
him with the observation that he was as fit to be
chancellor as an ass to play the lute, or a kicking cow
to spin silk.</p>

<p>In the Storkyrka<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> had been crowned in 1520 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
last sovereign of united Scandinavia, Christian II.,
a Dane of the Oldenburg line. Not by any means a
bad king on the whole (p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>), he had nevertheless by
some inscrutable mental process got it into his head
that the destruction of the leading men of Sweden
would benefit that country and help to consolidate his
own power. So during the very festivities that
followed the coronation, no other specific charge being
handy, he availed himself of the one complaint that
can never fail, and on a trumped-up charge connected
with religion, he caused many of the nobles and most
honoured men of Sweden to be executed in the market-place
of the capital. But the effect of the fatal
Blood Bath of Stockholm, on November 8, 1520, was
far other than the monarch planned. A deliverer for
the wronged nation rose up in the son of one of those
who perished.</p>

<p>An outlaw fugitive, Gustaf Vasa had several very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
narrow escapes from the machinations of Danish
spies, but the peasants of Dalekarlia were sufficiently
sympathetic to shield him, though at the risk of their
lives. They had no very particular grievances and
merely desired to live in peace; to his first patriotic
harangue they listened in irritating silence. So, sick
at heart and weary of body, the hero was plodding
through the snow to seek a secure retreat for himself
among the remote mountains of Norway. He heard
himself hotly followed, but, looking round, was joyed
to see not pursuing Danes, but penitent dalesmen.
They had heard of the Blood Bath and of many other
acts of cruelty and had come to agree with Gustaf.
They now asked no more than to be led against the
forces of the tyrant king. "For our country we will
fight like men," they cried. "Come back, Gustaf,
and be our chief."</p>

<p>And with them he returned to found one of the
most brilliant lines of sovereigns that Europe ever
knew. The Danes could make little stand before the
enthusiastic fury of the rising Swedes; one of their
own leaders declared that the devil himself could not
subdue a people who lived by drinking water and
eating bread baked from the bark of trees, and in
1523 Gustaf entered Stockholm as king, and knelt in
thanksgiving before the same altar that had witnessed
the coronation of the tyrant only three years before.
His spirit broods over the city to-day, before the Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of Knights and in the Northern Museum his colossal
statue stands.</p>

<p>But it was to a capital in ruin that he came, and
only three hundred families were camping amidst its
broken walls. So serious did conditions seem to the
new king that he ordered every other town in Sweden
to pay Stockholm a tax of ten stout burghers, compensation
to be sought from neighbouring farms.
The natural forces of these town-extending times have,
in Sweden as elsewhere, made such legislation more
than superfluous to-day. Though on the very edge
of the forest modern Stockholm is in some districts
over-crowded, underhoused.</p>

<p>Till far into the nineteenth century the Scandinavian
countries had the bad distinction of being the most
drunken in Europe: Linnæus as a scientist called
attention to the national danger of drink. That
Swedes and Norwegians are now the most abstemious
of Europeans is a striking comment on the early
Victorian maxim: "You can't make men sober by
Act of Parliament."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>So heavenly are the environs of the city that they
could not easily be spoiled; the Swedes have made
the very most of the lavish gifts of Nature to add to
the delights of their capital. They are not infected
with a mania for cutting trees and building mile-long
lines of slate and brick, nor apparently is every landowner
consumed with a burning zeal to pile as many
dwellings as he possibly can onto each square inch
of ground. Parks are numerous and beautiful,
largely because the woods are left alone.</p>

<p>Of the nine islands the largest except one and by
far the most interesting is Djurgarden, so called because
there was a deer-park in days gone by. A
great part of its area is still left alone, forming a
park almost unrivalled in the world. Wide stretches
of primeval forest, miles of rockbound coast lapped
by the rippling waters of the lake. At Skansen,
midst the woods on elevated ground, is a splendid
museum in the open air. Among the trees one keeps
discovering all sorts of interesting things. Log houses
with old furniture in which Swedes dressed as their
fathers dressed play on musical instruments used of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
old. Other old cottages, moved from far, are
boulder-built, turf-roofed, and hard mud-floored.
Animals in cages, which are partly cut in rock,
old Runic stones, old gravestones, old milestones are
there too.</p>

<p>And in parts the aborigines are housed, just as if
in their native wilds. A wonderful people are these
Lapps. For more than a thousand years they have
lived in close proximity to one of the most cultured
of all races, with which they have had constant intercourse
and trade; yet here they are, exactly as
Tacitus describes the Fenni, untaught barbarians and
a standing contradiction to Rousseau's theories about
the noble savage. Modern anthropology smiles at
Dr. Johnson's crude remark, "One set of savages is
like another." Nevertheless the huts of the Lapps
seem strangely to reproduce the general atmosphere
of those of the South African Kafirs.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The way in
which the Lapps have so long resisted the seductions
of civilisation is all the more remarkable in contrast
with their near cousins the Finns.</p>

<p>On the highest land, called Bredablick, rises a tall
tower from which may be enjoyed a view that is one
of the most individual upon earth. Miles and miles
of rolling woodland, chiefly pine and birch, spread in
almost endless folds and display almost every shade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of green. Arms of water stretch away in all directions
till in many cases they become so narrow that they are
lost among the trees; the broad end of Mälar, myriad
island lake, suggests itself on the western horizon,
and, the very last thing one would naturally expect to
see amid the silent woods, rises the great modern city
with its towers and spires and domes and factory
chimneys&mdash;the Venice of the North. Round the far
horizon stand peaceful, peakless hills.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>A few miles north of Stockholm, far enough away
to be beyond the furthest suburb of the town, a beautiful
park slopes down to where the now narrowing
and now widening Edsvik runs into the land. The
property was once owned by Prince Ulrik, son of
Charles XI., and from him has its name, Ulriksdal.
Some of the most characteristic features of the scenery
of two continents seem to be epitomised in the district
all around. By the eternal forest of northern trees,
and the constant clearings in glacial boulder-earth
for farms, with wooden house and barn, by electric
trolley cars and muddy roads, New England is recalled.
Wide heather-covered wastes and gnarled old firs,
thatched buildings here and there, do much to suggest
the delightful landscapes of old Scotland.</p>

<p>Presumably it is the best of the land that has been
cleared for crops, though it is not always very easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
declare why one acre is bearing artichokes<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and the
next one is left to the woods.</p>

<p>Approached through grand avenues of maple and
lime and oak, surrounding three sides of a squared
pierced by three tiers of windows, and surmounted
by a black clock turret, smaller than many English
country houses, is the Ulriksdal summer palace of the
Swedish kings. It was erected in the seventeenth
century by the renowned Field-Marshal Jacob de la
Gardie, he who became the husband of Ebba Brahe,
dearly loved by Gustavus Adolphus, to whom she was
betrothed, though never wed. For the great king,
whom half Europe in arms could not withstand, was
unable to resist the pressure of his mother, intriguing
queen, who would not have royal blood allied with
common human clay. And by his German princess
wife, whom he could never love, the king had no other
child than the erratic Christina, brilliant and irresponsible
as Mary Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>At this palace in 1871 the famous American explorer
of Africa, Paul Du Chaillu, was received by King
Charles XV. with Arcadian lack of ceremony that
was rather disconcerting to the American conception
of what royalty should do. The explorer could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
no attention at the front door, but eventually raised
some underling by going within and shouting up the
stair. This official looked over the balusters and
asked the intruder what he wanted. The king, he
averred, was not at home, but when he learned that
an invited guest stood there, he admitted that the
monarch of two kingdoms was within. His Majesty
was found at last, working on a picture in his shirt-sleeves,
for he was a landscape painter of repute. As
soon as he saw Du Chaillu approaching he proceeded
to put on his coat.</p>

<p>Wearing a broad-brimmed soft felt hat, the monarch
led the explorer through the house from room to room.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
The general effect is splendid, but not unhomelike.
One chamber is lined with old Dutch tiles, another with
stamped leather in colours of the softest and most
restful, other apartments have fine old panelling, while
the northern sunlight streams in through some beautiful
pieces of painted glass, the oldest about 1504 in
date. The richness of the effect is greatly enhanced
by fine old inlaid cabinets, choice china and some very
good pictures.</p>

<p>Some cities, such as Oxford and Rome, owe almost
everything to the activities of man: few would linger
long by the Isis or the Tiber if their magnificent old
buildings were gone. Some cities owe nearly everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to splendour of site and to the lavish gifts of God.
Such a one pre-eminently is Stockholm. Other towns
have sites more stately, streets more monumental,
buildings more magnificent, but none can be compared
with Stockholm in the features of water and island
and forest that are peculiarly its own. There is
another city built on islands by flowing waters near
the open sea, but New York has pushed the forest
far away except for a space on the New Jersey side,
and both islands and city are far too big to bear any
resemblance to Stockholm.</p>

<p>Though no such impression could well be sustained
in the streets of a great modern city, the first view
of the Swedish capital suggests nothing so much as an
enchanted town, the capital of fairyland in the middle
of a wood that one dreamed about as a little child.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pn center large b1">ST. PETERSBURG</p>

<p class="pbq">What must the man have been who, born and bred in this
atmosphere, conceived and by one tremendous wrench, almost
by his own manual labour and his own sole gigantic strength,
executed the prodigious idea of dragging the nation, against
its will, into the light of Europe, and erecting a new capital
and a new empire among the cities and kingdoms of the world.</p>

<p class="pbq">St. Petersburg is indeed his most enduring monument.
A spot up to that time without a single association, selected
instead of the Holy City to which even now every Russian turns
as to his mother; a site which but a few years before had belonged
to his most inveterate enemies, won from morass and forest,
with difficulty defended, and perhaps even yet doomed to fall
before the inundations of its own river.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dean Stanley.</span></p>


<p class="pn p2">Russia, or Garthrealm, was not outside the circuit
of saga lands. The <i>Heimskringla</i> indeed has much to
tell us concerning it in days when the country formed
a most hospitable refuge for those in trouble at home.
And at one time or other most prominent men of the
viking age were in that uncomfortable position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Slavs themselves, indeed, we do not learn a
great deal. The saga writers were not much interested
in foreign countries except as they affected the Norse,
but the regard for law in Russia evidently made an
impression, as did also the respect entertained for
woman there, at any rate as she was represented by
the queen. The chief town of Russia in those days
was called by the Norsemen Holmgarth, because it
stood on an island, to the Slavs it was known as
Novgorod, or new town, although about the oldest we
wot of in the land. It became in rather later days
the eastern outpost of Hansa trade (p. <a href="#Page_155">155</a>).</p>

<p>Russia herself, like Normandy, was originally
a Scandinavian state, and there seems to be little
doubt that the name Russ was originally applied to
the Norse. Even to-day the Finns know the Swedes
as Ruotsi.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Thus Ruric and his viking followers<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> gave
a name to the Slavs of the North, even as Bulgars
from Asia named a portion of the Slavs of the South
and the German Franks gave a new designation to
Gaul. In all three cases the conquerors who gave a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
new name to the conquered received from them language
and nearly everything else. It is quite possible,
however, that Scandinavian vigour was potent in
giving to northern Slavland that political unity which
neither Mongol domination, nor the long lapse of
centuries nor a series of drunken and incapable
monarchs ever succeeded in breaking up.</p>

<p>While the disastrous failure of the southern Slavs
to unite is patent to the whole earth.</p>

<p>Closely in touch with the Northlands Garthrealm
long remained; it was clearly a district in which the
Norse could feel themselves perfectly at home, however
much at times they might feel the call of the
rockbound fjords. Thus for several centuries, from
the British Isles to the heart of Russia, all lands were
Scandinavian pure, or under the influence of the ever
conquering Norse. Had the race possessed a spark
of Roman organising power, here had been established
a dominion greater than any that the Southlands
knew, for such an empire had hardly failed to girdle
the world, expanding eastward through northern
Asia, westward from Vinland the Good. Knut the
Rich (p. <a href="#Page_114">114</a>) seems to have been about the only
individual to whom any such ideas occurred, and the
very keenness of all the Norse about local autonomy
and parochial Things was a hopeless bar to such plans.</p>

<p>It is one of the chief characteristics of the Norse
easily to be absorbed by other races, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
ancient viking times or in the American North-West
to-day. On Ireland they left no further impression
than a few traditions and a church dedication or two;
to Russia they gave a name, but little more. Norsemen
failed to be absorbed by other races only in
Iceland and Faroe, where no other races were.</p>

<p>Both Olaf, son of Tryggvi, and Olaf the Saint,
were at different times resident in Russia, when
Norway proved unkind. The former was nine winters
old when he came into Garthrealm, and he abode
with King Valdimar other nine winters.</p>

<p>One day the boy was standing idly in the gate of
the city when he suddenly noticed the person who
had slain his fosterer. "Olaf had a little axe in his
hand, which same he drave into Klerkon's head, so
that it stood right down in the brain of him; then
he fell to running home to the house, and told Sigurd
his kinsman thereof." Such a spirited action would
not have mattered much in Scandinavia, for in those
days the Norse were very tolerant toward such effervescence
of youthful spirits, but it was otherwise in
Russia.</p>

<p>"Now in Holmgarth was the peace so hallowed,
that, according to the law thereof, whoso slew a man
undoomed should himself be slain. And now all
the people made a rush together, according to their
custom and law, and sought after the lad, where he
were; and it was told that he was in the queen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
garth, and that there was an host of men all
armed.</p>

<p>"Hereof was the king told, and he went thereto
with his folk, and would not that they fought, and
so brought about truce and peace thereafter; and
the king adjudged the weregild, and the queen paid
the fine.</p>

<p>"Thereafter abode Olaf with the queen, and was
right dear to her."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Why the queen, to whom Sigurd had hastily
entrusted the boy, was able to do so much is explained
to us later on: "Now it was much the wont of mighty
kings in those days, that the queen should have half
the court, and sustain it at her own costs, and have
thereto of the scat and dues what she needed. And
thus it was at King Valdimar's, and the queen had
no less court than the king; and somewhat would
they strive about men of fame, and either of them
would have such for themselves.</p>

<p>"Now so it befell that the king trowed those redes
aforesaid which folk spake before him, and became
somewhat cold to Olaf, and rough. And when Olaf
found that, he told the queen thereof, and said withal
that he was minded to fare into the Northlands,
where, said he, his kin had dominion aforetime"
and where he deemed it like that he should have the
most furtherance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"So the queen biddeth him farewell, and sayeth
that he shall be deemed a noble man whithersoever
he cometh."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The reasons for the king's suspicion are rather
delicately explained: "Yet it befell, as oft it doth
when outland men have dominion, or win fame more
abundant than they of the land, that many envied
him the great love he had of the king, and of the queen
no less. So men bade the king beware lest he make
Olaf over-great: 'For there is the greatest risk of
such a man, lest he lend himself to doing thee or the
realm some hurt, he being so fulfilled of prowess and
might and the love of men; nor forsooth wot we
whereof he and the queen are evermore talking.'"</p>

<p>Olaf the Holy was in slightly later days to find a
refuge in Russia and to be welcomed there by a
Scandinavian queen, daughter of his old enemy and
namesake, the King of Sweden. This was the manner
of the royal marriage, and somewhat modern it sounds.
"The next spring there came to Sweden messengers
from King Jarisleif east away from Holmgarth, and
they fared to see to the matter of King Olaf's promise
from the past summer to give Ingigerd his daughter
to King Jarisleif. King Olaf put the matter before
Ingigerd, and said it was his will that she should wed
King Jarisleif."</p>

<p>Driven from his kingdom and somewhat broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in his fortunes, "King Olaf arrayed his journey and
got him a ship. And he fared that summer, and
letted not till he came east to Garth-realm to the
meeting of King Jarisleif, him and his queen, Ingigerd....
King Jarisleif gave King Olaf a hearty
welcome, and bade him abide there with him and
have land as much as he needed for the costs of
holding of his company. That King Olaf took with
thanks, and tarried there. So it is said, that King
Olaf was devout and prayerful unto God all the days
of his life. But from the time that he found his reign
was waning, and his enemies were waxing mightier,
then he laid all his heart to the serving of God; he
was then hindered herefrom no more by other cares,
or the toil which aforetime he had had on hand."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>"Sithence King Olaf came to Garth-realm he had
great imaginings, and turned it over in his mind what
rede he had best take. King Jarisleif and Queen
Ingigerd bade King Olaf dwell with them, and take
over the dominion called Vulgaria, and that is one
part of Garth-realm; and there in that land the folk
was heathen. King Olaf bethought him in his mind
of this offer; but when he laid it before his men, they
all were loth to take up their abode there, and egged
the king on to betake himself north to Norway to his
own kingdom. The king would be still further thinking
of this, to lay down his kingdom, and fare out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the world unto Jerusalem, or into some other holy
places, and there to go under the Rule."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Not infrequently the Norse passed through Russia
to the great metropolis of the eastern world (whence
Russia had received her faith), New Rome, or Constantinople
itself. So much were they impressed by
that splendid city that they knew it as Micklegarth.
The stalwart arms of the Norsemen, organised in the
Vaeringian Guard, propped the Byzantine Empire
against its Asian foes and gained for the Scandinavians
much wealth. Among others the founder of
Oslo (p. <a href="#Page_95">95</a>) had in that realm gotten enormous riches.
"But when Harald came to Holmgarth, King Jarisleif
gave him a wondrous good welcome, and there he
tarried the winter over, and took into his own keeping
all the gold which he had sent afore thither from
Micklegarth, and many kinds of dear-goods. That
was so mickle wealth, that no man in northern lands
had seen such in one man's owning. Harald had
three times come into palace-spoil whiles he was in
Micklegarth. For that is law, that whenever the
king of the Greeks dies the Vaerings shall have
palace-spoil; they shall then go over all the king's
palaces where are his wealth hoards, and there each
one shall freely have for his own whatso he may lay
hands on."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>
<p>Strangely similar, both in weakness and in strength,
were Alexander and Peter, both of them most justly
surnamed Great. Each was born to a kingdom, each
had marvellous foresight and each had imperial ideas.
Semi-barbarous sceptres they both inherited, and
they realised how much might be done by importing
the civilisation of sea-powers further west; each was
a worker with his own hands, each cared much for
the science and art of his generation, but neither was
superior to amusements of the grossest and pastimes
of the beastliest. Both drank themselves into the
other world at an untimely age, leaving their work
half done.</p>

<p>Each is commemorated by a city placed on the sea
with the express purpose of attracting foreign influence,
beyond the ancient limits of the country whose
capital it became. More attractive in some ways
the career of the Ptolemaic successors of Alexander
at Alexandria than that of the immediate Romanoff
descendants of Peter at Petersburg, but the story of
an ancient nation ruled from a corner of its territory
by a half foreign court is in both cases very much the
same.</p>

<p>Many of the capitals of Europe know at least
traditional founders, but on none is impressed the
stamp of an individual to such an extent as here.
No city on earth of anything like equal importance is
so entirely the creation of a single mind, nor so truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a monument to individual force of character. No
capital except Tokyo is to such an extent the symbol
of a new era in a nation's life.</p>

<p>Peter heard the call of Europe and saw that it had
something to offer that Asia could not give. Asiatics
have felt a strange attraction toward European lands
in all the ages of the world. Persian, Hun, Saracen
and Turk have each in turn sought a footing on
European soil. Despite administrative inconvenience
the successive rulers of the House of Othman early
desired to have as their capital some city famous in the
story of the West. Peter's people were not Asiatics;
their early organisation had come from the purest
European stock, the conquering Norse themselves,
their civilisation and religion had come straight from
Rome. Not indeed old Rome on the Tiber, but during
the tenth century the daughter city by the Bosphorus
was probably the more cultured of the two.</p>

<p>On the border-land of the continents the Russians
had for centuries looked east and not west, the very
year of Peter's accession to power (1689) they had
fixed their first frontier with China. He desired that
Russia should be definitely European, and in order to
consolidate his reforms a westward-looking window
was essential. Its communications must be by sea,
Poland shut out direct intercourse with Europe overland.
Southward was the better climate, but a Black
Sea port would have increased relations with a purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Oriental Empire. At the farthest end of the icy
Baltic, where the Neva flows into the Gulf of Finland,
as near to ancient Novgorod as a seaside town could
be, there eventually he decided the new capital of
Russia should stand.</p>

<p>From a glance at the map it is difficult to realise
why no town had risen in so convenient a spot long
before, but it is at once explained by a glance at
the ground. Swampy forest, liable to floods and
dangerous to health, extended over all the land where
the City of Peter was to rise. The island that became
the nucleus of the settlement had received a name
from its hares. A few Finnish fishers, alone among
mankind, broke the silence of its woods. The noble
river communicates with little except timber forests,
and wood is to-day brought down to Petersburg in
temporary boats remarkable for their size, their
frailty, and their graceful appearance.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of founding a city in such
a spot were such as might well have appalled any
ordinary mind. The site had but a few years before
belonged to the Swedes, who maintained a small
fort on the edge of Ladoga, the lake which the
Neva drains. They were constantly making attacks;
Charles XII. remarked that Peter was founding cities
only that he might capture them. Petersburg might
well have anticipated the fate of Port Arthur.</p>

<p>The wretched conditions in which operations had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to be carried on brought about an appalling mortality
among the workmen employed in building the new
town, however much exaggerated may have been the
foreign reports that two hundred thousand died.
The mechanical appliances available were so extraordinarily
poor that earth had to be carried by each
workman as best he could; there was no one about
who could construct a wheelbarrow! Brigands made
communications with Russia unsafe and sometimes
did as they pleased in the city itself, while sentries
on duty or citizens going about their business were
occasionally carried off by the wolves. Provisions
had to be fetched from an enormous distance, the cost
of living was extremely high. Though the woods
were all around, fuel was so scarce that even the nobles
(who most unwillingly had been compelled to live
here for part of the year) were not allowed to have
hot baths excepting once a week.</p>

<p>To add to all this no one except Peter could see the
slightest need for any other capital than Moscow,
still less the point of building a city on this forbidding
and man-forsaken spot. But to the Tsar the rising
town was a Paradise, so well loved that he had soon
decided to make it not merely the chief seaport of
his Empire, but the capital as well.</p>

<p>The objection which the sagas tell us the eleventh
century Russians showed to outland men having
dominion was fully shared by eighteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Russians, and the huge number of them employed
about St. Petersburg helped still more to increase the
general loathing for the new capital. Hardly a nation
of Europe failed to supply Peter with friends and
fellow-workers. He honoured them above his own
subjects. Nor did it matter in the least in what
circumstances he happened to encounter them. One
day as he was inspecting the operations he chanced to
notice working with the other convicts a scion of the
fightingest family of Scotland, who, born in Sweden,
combined with the surname of Douglas the designation
of Gustaf Otto. Captured at Pultowa he entered the
Russian service; having slain a general in wrath, he
entered a Russian jail. But to Peter his failings did
not appear at all seriously to cry to heaven for
vengeance. He could well make allowance for the
spirit of a Douglas when provoked, so restored him to
all his honours. In 1719 the now Russified Swede-Scot
seized the ancient capital of Finland, and bore in
triumph from the cathedral of Abo the bones of Henry
the English saint (p. <a href="#Page_188">188</a>).<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The only antiquities of St. Petersburg are the
structures connected with the life of the strenuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
founder. Peter's cottage, which was erected soon
after the works began in 1703, is a large four-roomed,
shingle-roof, log-hut; and the living-room which
still contains the simple wooden furniture that he
used enables one to some extent to picture the backwoods
life of the imperial pioneer. The whole is
enclosed in a larger structure of brick, and a miracle-eikon
is the central feature of the shrine that now
occupies the chamber where the great Tsar slept.</p>

<p>Never perhaps was Peter so happy as when he was
living here. He hated lofty rooms and luxurious
furniture and costly food. He liked to wear his oldest
clothes and enjoyed working with his own hands. As a
great concession to his wife he consented at Catherine's
coronation to wear a gold-embroidered coat, but could
think of nothing except the fact that its cost would
have paid for several soldiers. In Paris he found
the luxury of the Louvre absolutely insupportable.
After looking impatiently at the sumptuous feast
set out, he dined off radishes and bread which he
washed down with two glasses of beer. After a
contemptuous survey of the superbly fitted French
bedrooms, he rested for the night on a camp-bed set
up in a closet.</p>

<p>Close by the cottage was the small wooden church
of the Trinity with two towers and onion domes which
Peter built, but which was burned down early in
1913.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>A picturesque appearance is given to the Neva's
northern bank by the old fort with its needle spire of
gold that stands on a little island of its own, close to
the cottage and Trinity church. Peter's old earth
bastions were faced with granite in later days and
the east gate is dated 1740. For defending anything
whatever the fortress is no more use than the Tower
of London, but within are pleasant avenues of trees,
and over the roofs of the barracks and other buildings
rises the famous Cathedral of SS. Peter and Paul,
where rest the city's founder and the later Tsars.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
A soldiers' city from the very first St. Petersburg has
been, and such it is to-day. Troops constantly pass
along the streets; sentries with bayonets fixed are
to be seen on every hand. The thoroughfares are
patrolled by policemen, each armed with baton,
revolver and sword.</p>

<p>Peter planned to build rather a canal town of
Holland than a boulevard city of France. Many of
the canals have been filled up, but beside one of those
that remain, in the corner of the beautiful Summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Gardens, stands the delightful two-storey house with
plaster bas-reliefs and metal roof that Dutch workmen
built for Peter; it is known as his palace to-day.
The rooms inside, doored and shuttered with panelled
oak and partly lined with blue Dutch tiles, have a
most cheerful and pleasant character; they contain
some rather good carved work that was tooled by the
great Tsar; a mirror-case with stag, foliage, birds and
other things is signed and dated "Peter. 1710."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>In this same year he founded a Battle Abbey in
thanksgiving for his victories, although he fully
realised the need for reducing the extremely large
number of monks that Russia contained. This
convent helps one to realise how well Peter came to
understand the people that he ruled. If the new
city was really to be the capital of this pious land,
something of old Russia, of Holy Russia, must be
brought into its midst. Most fortunately for Peter's
plans it chanced that as early as 1241 a Russian
general had gotten the surname of Nevski from a
victory he gained over a Swedish army on the banks
of the Neva; he had also become one of the most
venerated of Russian saints. Thus the enshrining
of his relics in the cloister church brought to St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Petersburg one of the holiest things in all the land.
Venerable associations that meant much to the devout
were secured to the brand new town.</p>

<p>The very ornate silver shrine stands at present in
the south transept of the church or cathedral which
was erected for Catherine II. by a Russian architect
named Staroff.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The peace that broods over this
quiet cloister rather reminds one of the south of
Europe. The picturesque convent buildings of yellow
and bluish-white plaster are seen among gardens and
trees, while over them appear the towers and dome
of the cathedral and the steeples of the smaller chapels,
in one of which Suworof is at rest. Across a placid
canal is the burial ground of the monks. Even in
Russia these men are famous for the beauty with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
which they sing the daily offices of the church, unaccompanied
by any kind of instrument&mdash;for such is
never allowed in buildings of the Communion of the
East.</p>

<p>A roadway cut straight through the forest between
this convent and the Admiralty formed the beginning
of the chief street of the present day city, the well-known
Nevski Prospect. The Admiralty stands on
the Neva side where Peter built his first boat on the
Baltic; it forms the chief centre of the city, to which
many of the streets converge. The building in some
ways is one of the best in the city, erected in the
Renaissance style by a Russian architect named
Zucharoff. A ship in full sail forms a vane on the
needle spire that rises from a square tower lined with
Ionic columns, while the vast building, measuring
over 1,300 by 500 feet, is well managed, the long façade
being relieved from serious monotony by an imposing
gateway in the centre and by the pilastered wings
rising much higher than the plainer middle part.</p>

<p>Close by is the splendid Winter Palace, another
Renaissance building, designed in 1754 by Rastrelli
but considerably modified after a fire in 1837.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
side faces the river, the other looks on, to the square
in which rises the tall monolith column that commemorates
Alexander I.&mdash;the site of the terrible
scenes of January, 1905. By an archway over the
street the palace is joined to the Hermitage, which
houses one of the finest collections on the earth.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>While St. Petersburg has been greatly influenced
by the street architecture of Italy and France, its
broadways have a distinct character of their own and
resemble the thoroughfares of no other city. Over
streets roughly paved with sharp-edged stones, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
upturned ends of logs, rattle droskeys, whose shafts
and traces both start from the axle-trees. The horses
wear high hames and the drivers long beards, for
Peter's commands that all must shave are now no
longer enforced.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The pace at which the horses move
is a great contrast to the leisurely dignity that characterises
the citizens.</p>

<p>Over the windows of most of the shops are painted
pictures of what men sell within, for many of the
customers are unable to read and appreciate this
guide. Huge gargoyles shoot waterfalls from rain
or melting snow on to the pavements below them, so
that much caution must be used in walking about in
wet weather. Something of the café life of the
Continent is to be seen under the creepers and trees of
the pleasant courtyards of hotels. The way in which
men kiss each other both here and in the public streets
is at first sight rather startling to races trained to
keep emotions more suppressed, but there is nothing
insincere, and&mdash;coupled with many qualities one
would fain see changed&mdash;there is a certain gentle and
affectionate disposition about the Russians that
becomes more and more attractive as one gets to
know them better.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">The most prominent, and in some ways the most
interesting, building in the city is the Metropolitan
Church of Russia, the great Cathedral of St. Isaac of
Dalmatia, on whose festival Peter was born. Other
statesmen have chosen new capitals but have been
satisfied to leave the ecclesiastical centre in the older
town. No half measures for Peter. Even the holy
Patriarchate of Moscow, sacred to the whole of Eastern
Christendom in a sense from making up again the
number of five after the western one had lapsed into
heresy (from the eastern point of view), he insisted
upon sweeping away.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> It was one of the duties of the
Tsar to lead the donkey upon which the Patriarch
rode on Palm Sunday, and that seemed to Peter to be
putting the relations between Church and State on
to a footing wholly wrong. A patriarch once found
fault with the shabby-looking European dress of the
emperor, who had discarded the flowing robes of the
East, and Peter had retorted that he would have
expected the head of the Church to be otherwise
engaged than in minding the business of tailors. So
when the patriarch died he did not name another, and
at last when the priests begged that some one might
sit in the throne, he is said to have sat there himself
with the remark that he would be patriarch. The
Holy Synod was organised instead and the Church
lost almost entirely its old comparative independence
of the State. The synod building is close to the
cathedral and the highest dignitary of the Russian
Church is now the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The existing Cathedral of St. Isaac was forty years
in building and was finished in 1858, the architect
being a Frenchman, the Chevalier de Montferrand.
In magnificence of material it surpasses almost all,
and in excellence of position it excels very many of
the great churches of Christendom. Its chief merit
is that it is the one building in the capital that really
suggests durability and permanence. There is just
a faint suggestion&mdash;very slight indeed, but still impossible
entirely to shake off&mdash;of temporary exhibition
buildings about the acres and acres of plaster in which
the other great monuments of the capital are sheathed.
But this cathedral is of solid marble or stone, and in its
proportions the most massive large church in Christendom,
a very considerable part indeed of its area being
occupied by walls and piers.</p>

<p>On the four sides of the church stand the four
noblest porticoes that have been erected since Roman
days. With the proneness of the Eastern Church to
symbolism these glorious portals might have been
made to suggest the City of God, but the opportunity
was hopelessly lost; on the east there is no entrance
at all, and the design cannot for one moment be compared
with that of St. Sophia, St. Peter's or St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Paul's. Indeed, what was intended for stately
simplicity has degenerated into the most hopeless
commonplace.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>
<p>Between St. Isaac's and the river are really beautiful
gardens in which stands the famous equestrian statue
of Peter (by the French sculptor, Falconet), that
Catherine II. erected in 1782, on a huge block of
granite.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The composition is extremely spirited and
it certainly ranks very high among monuments of a
similar kind over the whole world. The general
effect of this wide open space with fine Renaissance
structures all round, including those on the far side
of the river, is exceedingly stately, especially when
seen for the first time.</p>

<p>National character is always mirrored in national
architecture, but seldom quite as here. The plan of
the city is European and the conception is of the
stateliest; the flat and rather featureless site on both
sides of a noble river is just such as to give the very
utmost opportunity for splendid architectural display.
The style chosen for the buildings, the Classic Renaissance
as it was developed in France and Italy, is
perhaps more suited than any other for the objects
which successive emperors had in view. The magnificence
of the great broad streets and boulevards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the ample squares and frequent monuments all give
the impression in very truth of one of the grandest
of European capitals.</p>

<p>The effect that should be produced by the lavish
expenditure of money and the splendour of much of
the material are somewhat neutralised, however, by
the fact that the great palaces and churches (with the
exception of St. Isaac's) profess to be what they are not,
and expose to the air no other material than stucco.
The very elements rebel against so much imposture
and bring down great patches of plaster, while western
rulers have been utterly powerless to prevent the
appearance of extremely eastern features in every
corner of the town.</p>

<p>But in spite of all defects of detail these uniform
Classic buildings, well grouped and set off by wide
spaces and trees, produce a really magnificent effect,
and as often as the black peaty earth is exposed by
taking up the streets for drains one realises more fully
the miracle of all these sumptuous structures founded
in security upon a quaking bog.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Here is a city,
one feels, that was raised by a people of iron will, a
nation that was only invigorated by the centuries of
Mongol domination; a people who seek to be western
Europeans, but as a nation are not, though many
individuals among them are leaders in European
thought and science too. In some respects St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Petersburg gives one the impression of being the
capital of a vast dominion more than any other city
on the globe. Even in the British Empire there is
nothing that appeals to the imagination quite in the
same way as the fact that from the Russian capital one
may travel entirely on Russian territory to the
frontier of Austria, to the frontier of Japan or to a
point within thirty-six miles of American soil.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, whether for evil or good, the spirit of
the West is not here. The leaders of Asia think, but
the leaders of Europe act. Tolstoy and Kropotkin,
household words in countless English homes, have
done as much as almost any others to sustain the
present conditions in Russia by the very elaborateness
of their programmes. When England yearned as
Russia yearns she found a Cromwell, not a Tolstoy.
He grasped a sword and the scabbard was thrown
away. He had little to say to the world, but plenty
to say to the king. The gentler Russian masses
idolise a man who held an open book for all the world
to read, yet did little to change the constitution of his
own times&mdash;so far as on the surface shows. And for
all practical purposes the great Russian Empire still
retains the constitution that Ruric gave his conquering
hordes. Law is the word of the prince.</p>

<p>With the House of Commons (ten years after it had
put a new sovereign on the throne) Peter seems to
have been less favourably impressed than with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
other English institution. On seeing the lawyers in
Westminster Hall he is recorded to have remarked
that there were only two such people in all Russia
and he was going to hang them on his return. Peter
did not see that, however much they may be sneered
at, Parliaments and Law Courts are of the very essence
of western civilisation. Japanese guns at Port
Arthur greatly helped to set up indeed a <i>duma</i> in the
city of Peter, but the very place where it meets
indicates the extent of its power. The Taurida
Palace stands far east of the imposing mass of really
important Government buildings and is in a somewhat
squalid quarter of the town.</p>

<p>European indeed is this city at first glance, wholly
western in style, in fact one of the most striking groups
of European buildings anywhere on earth to be seen.
But step into a side street. Behold the life of the
East! Behold Asiatic bazaars! Goods displayed
on quaint little open stalls whose owners sit among
their wares and make their calculations on the <i>abacus</i>
just as one may see in China. And the smells of Asia
are there, and the leisurely pigeons of the East. The
unhastening manner in which everything goes on likewise
does much to intensify the underlying oriental
atmosphere of the city. Look up to where the church
towers are crowned by the onion domes of Tatary
against a European sky. Europe in the square, Asia
in the lane! Vast Government buildings reflect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
spirit of the West, but toward the painted screens
of the churches moves the changeless mind of the
East. The concealed spear of the Tatar pierces the
garment of the European. There is no need to
scratch.</p>

<p class="b1">It is a very real relief that one important building
openly reverts to the ancient native style, and brings
to the new capital a breath of Russian mediævalism.
It need hardly be said that it is a church; it commemorates
Alexander II. (p. <a href="#Page_244">244</a>) and is appropriately
dedicated to the Resurrection, raised over the spot
where he fell.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The outlines of the national story may
be read in those of the church. The style is an
attempt at Byzantine, and that reminds us of the fact
that it was to Constantinople and the Eastern Church
that Russia eventually went when in search of a new
faith long centuries ago. The effort to produce the
kind of effect of which St. Sophia is the noblest
example is, however, extremely crude; Slavs could
never really fathom the subtlety of the mind of
Greece. The nine cupolas<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> are surmounted (and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
character of the building is greatly influenced) by
onion domes so common in the turbaned East, imposed
upon Russia with much else during the long centuries
of Mongol rule. The presence of this feature gives to
all truly Russian churches something of the look of
Indian and Central Asian mosques. But this point
is concealed by the Russian priests, who, with their
natural proneness to symbolism, will explain that these
onion domes are in reality modelled on rosebuds,
thus typifying the embryo Church on earth, destined
to blossom hereafter in Heaven. Each cupola
supports a cross with chains (p. <a href="#Page_186">186</a>) which surmounts
a crescent to symbolise the triumph of Christianity
over Islam and the long series of eastern wars in
which Russia has been engaged. The interior with
its glorious and most striking Italian mosaics evidences
the western influences that have spread over
Russia in latter years.</p>

<p class="p1">The first ship to enter the port of St. Petersburg
(in November, 1703) was Dutch, and it brought a
cargo of wine and salt. Peter himself acted as pilot
without telling the Hollanders who he was, but he
afterwards gave great rewards both to skipper and
crew, renamed the boat after the town, and freed it
for ever from Russian dues. An English vessel
arrived the same year.</p>

<p>Much earlier the Muscovy Company had originated
from the English efforts to discover the north-east
passage to Cathay, and during the reign of Mary and
Philip, Sebastian Cabot became its first Governor.
British trade has been prominent in St. Petersburg
ever since the town, began, and not far below the
Admiralty is the old English Quay. Saints carved
in stone mark the sky line of a large Classic building
that looks over the quay to the river, and forming a
long upper chamber is the pilastered Anglican
Church.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Suburbs of singular beauty are provided for St.
Petersburg by the lovely islands among which the
Neva winds, its different branches crossed by rough
bridges of wood. In places reeds and swamps still
border the woods, giving some idea of the original
nature of the hopeless-looking spot on which Peter
decided to build. Here are large private houses with
avenues and flower beds in the style of France, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
many of them have such large grounds that the general
impression in places is very much like that of the Bois
de Boulogne.</p>

<p>Even to-day the city of Peter is very largely isolated
from the world, approached by road or rail through
long miles of forest and swamp. Only on a small scale
is agriculture or market gardening to be seen. Nevertheless
two country palaces that the founder erected
in the vicinity are centres of some population, Tsarske
Selo among the woods on the way to Moscow and
Peterhof on the southern shore of the gulf. The new
Tatar-Byzantine church of the latter is a conspicuous
landmark from the decks of vessels steaming along
the Morskoi canal through the shallow waters between
the heavily fortified island of Cronstadt and the
timber port of the city itself.</p>

<p>Of early days at this place we get a rather graphic
description in a letter written by the Hanoverian
Resident named Weber in 1718: "When at last we
arrived at Cronslot, the Tsar invited us to his villa
at Peterhof. We went with a fair wind, and at dinner
warmed ourselves to such a degree with old Hungarian
wine, although His Majesty spared himself,
that on rising from the table we could scarcely keep
on our legs, and when we had been obliged to drain
quite a quart apiece from the hands of the Tsaritsa
we lost all our senses, and in that condition they
carried us out to different places, some to the garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
some to the woods, while the rest lay on the ground
here and there. At four o'clock they woke us up and
again invited us to the summer-house, where the
Tsar gave us each an axe and bade us follow him. He
led us into a young wood where he pointed out trees
which it was necessary to fell in order to make an alley
straight to the sea, about a hundred paces long, and
told us to cut down the trees. He himself began work
on the spot (there were seven of us besides the Tsar),
and although this unaccustomed work, especially
in our far from sober condition, was not at all to our
liking, we nevertheless cut boldly and diligently, so
that in about three hours the alley was ready and the
fumes of wine had entirely evaporated. None of us
did himself any harm except Minister X, who unconsciously
cut one tree and was knocked down by another,
badly scratched. After verbal thanks we received
our real recompense after supper in a second drink,
which was so strong that we were taken to our beds
unconscious."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Peter's old villa still exists, a compromise between
the styles of building that prevailed two centuries
ago in Holland and France, but on the top of
the wooded slope a long and beautiful palace has
been erected in the style of the Renaissance.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
chapel alone is Russian under five gilded onion
domes.</p>

<p>The French-looking grounds are famous for their
many fountains, whose water is brought from a lake
miles away. A large number of jets play in front of
the palace itself, and also beside the straight watercourse
that runs down from it to the sea. The effect
looking up through the trees from the road at the
bottom is one of the most fairy-like things on the
earth. Walking through the woods one comes upon
all sorts of fountains where they would be expected
least. Water runs downstairs or slips along a marble
way under ferns, or sprinkles a statue or an artificial
tree or plays among the columns of an Ionic temple in
ruin, or forms a sort of birthday cake by jets rising
higher and higher toward the centre. The effect of
all these fountains among the trees is really most
impressive, no other land has the like. But just
as one is beginning to feel that it is the most
magnificent thing upon earth one remembers that a
cold bath in a St. Petersburg hotel costs two shillings
and reflects on the water supply of the capital.</p>

<p>By an artificial tree are hidden jets to throw water
all over an ordinary-looking seat. Such was the idea
of a joke entertained by former Tsars, who also liked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
ride in carriages containing musical boxes under the
seats that used to play as they were drawn<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> along by
horses harnessed in red and gold. One may incidentally
pick up many interesting facts about the dead
rulers of Russia that are not inscribed on the page of
history.</p>

<p>Judged by results Peter was great indeed if mortal
ever was. We are not asked to call him morally
good. Alexandria has a magnificent position on the
shores of the busiest of seas. Constantinople has few
rivals in situation among all the cities of the world.
But both are eclipsed in importance by this whimsical
city that Peter insisted upon building among remote
and frozen swamps.</p>

<p>To turn a great people round and force them to look
west not east, to compel them to expect a golden
future who before looked to a golden past&mdash;this is as
near to an impossibility as ever was attempted in the
history of man. Yet to an amazing extent this Peter
actually did.</p>

<p>One's astonishment that he achieved so much is yet
further increased when it is realised that his life was
devoted very largely to frivolity and amusement,
that in serious and earnest endeavour he was far
surpassed by many who contrived to accomplish far
less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Of no individual that ever lived perhaps can it be
said that he consciously and deliberately influenced
the history of the world to the same extent as the
high-thinking, hard-working, hard-drinking, founder
of Petersburg.</p>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> The corona is very rich. Clustered pillars, with arches divided
by shafts and closed by stone screens, sustain the triforium, whose
two-light openings have large carved caps and varied tracery, and
the clearstorey with tall lancets. The dome-vault, which rises
above, is steadied perhaps, but hardly supported, by very thin
flying buttresses of rounded unconstructive form. The surrounding
aisle has the richest of mural arcading and little chapels open from
it to east and north and south.
</p>
<p class="pfn">
Into the east end of the quire a large arch opens from the corona
itself, and a small one each side from the aisle. The quire is almost
all rebuilt, pillars clustered or octagonal deeply fluted, with huge
carved caps, sustain triforium, clearstorey and vaulting of character
not dissimilar to those of the corona. The general effect is extremely
fine, and one is reminded a little of Holyrood Chapel at Edinburgh
and again of Lincoln Angel Quire. The corona recalls the similar
feature at Canterbury, but is very much more beautiful.
</p>
<p class="pfn">
The most remarkable feature of the nave is the long and unbuttressed
west front, 120 feet in extent. Two tiers of arches,
dating from about the year 1300, still remain; there is no division
of nave or aisle or tower, but three of the lower arches are pierced
by doors, the others are divided by shafts. The upper arches do
not correspond with the lower ones, than which they are much
smaller; they are trefoil-headed and by corbels converted into
niches. The general effect is a little like that of the west front of
Wells, but not to any very striking extent.
</p>
<p class="pfn">
The cathedral is entirely detached, but a short distance to the
south, forming barracks and a military museum to-day, are some
remains of the L-shaped Palace of the Archbishops, displaying
Romanesque and early pointed windows.</p></div>

superbly made roads for which Norway is so justly famed. They
rest upon about four feet of stonework, the pieces diminishing upwards
so far as size is concerned. The smaller streams are frequently
spanned by arches of hard granite or other rock so neatly cut that
no mortar need be used. Sometimes the road itself is cut in the
living rock of the hills. The engine sheds are quite a feature of the
city, and railways run southward to the new capital by the valleys
of Gula and Glommen and past Hamar on its lake, also eastward
into Sweden, among the mountains and the lakes. And at a place
called Hell the latter line branches northward to Sunnan, near
the head of Trondhjem Fjord.</p></div>

nave with aisles, and chancel with north chapel, both round-apsed.
The chapel opens to chancel and aisle by doorways rather than
arches. The low clearstorey is lighted only on the south, over the
east bay of the nave rises a tower that forms a lantern. The nave
arcades have thick round pillars with the simplest caps; the chancel
is vaulted at a much lower level than the wooden roof of the nave.
The inside is very striking.</p></div>

he did not essay to prescribe. Some of his most charming works,

much more interesting, both from its still standing where its builders
wished, and from its greater size; it also seems rather earlier in
date than the stabbur re-erected at Bygdö, and was probably built
about 1300. It is called the Finneloft, and is locally believed to
be the oldest wooden building in Norway that was not a church.
The basement is of slate stone, roughly walled, instead of, as at
Bygdö, timber-work resting on big stones. The first floor in both
is framed of flattened horizontal beams, dovetailed to fit at the
corners; but at the Finneloft there are little passages at the sides
occupying the space which at Bygdö is merely covered by the
overhanging of the upper storey. This stage in both cases is walled
with thick boards, placed vertically and overlapping each other.
The roofs are of flattish pitch and in the pleasant manner of the
North simple patterns are carved on doorpost and lintel and beam.
The little side passages and the manner in which the horizontal
beams are often mortised into the vertical remind one very much

far more obvious resemblance that Norwegian Stavekirkes bear to
Chinese temples. (See<a href="#ILLUSTRATED"> title-page.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> This remarkable little building, like several others of its class,
consists of nave with aisle all round, aisled chancel with apse and
an open cloister girdling the structure. The interior is lofty and
dark, pillars, walls and roof all of timber. The three roofs, of cloister,
aisle, and clearstorey, rising one above another, are increased to
six by a turret-like structure that rises in three stages from the
middle of the nave roof. The effect produced is singularly like that
of a small Chinese temple, especially as queer objects like dragons
project diagonally from the corners of the ridges. The cloister part
seems far more suited to China than to Norway. In England there
is a stavekirke at Greensted, near Ongar, supposed to have been
erected in 1013 as a resting-place for the body of St. Edmund. The
side walls are built of oak-trunks, but it is as plain as it could possibly
be.</p></div>

transepts, there is a nave of seven bays. At the west end this is
flanked by towers and an aisle girdles the structure from one tower
and back to the other, running all round the apse&mdash;for the transepts,
which no longer project, are reduced very largely to sections of the
aisles. In the sacristy may be seen remains of the arch between
the south transept and the eastern chapel which extended it before
it was cut back.
</p>
<p class="pfn">
The interior is very striking from the unusual and pleasing combination
of white and red. Bricks are exposed where are shafts and
at the edges of the arches; white plaster covers walls and vaults.
Many of the arches are round, but pointed ones are always used for
the plain quadripartite vaulting. The windows are all single, some
in groups of three, but they are numerous and wide enough to make
the building extremely light. The blindstorey (triforium) is open
to the church by arches about the same size as those that communicate
with the aisles. Round the apse these two tiers of arches
rest on shafts of granite, elsewhere stone is very sparingly used for
capitals and a few other details. The blindstorey, itself vaulted
above the vaulting of the aisles, forms a passage the whole way round
the church, a groined gallery on two pillars carrying it from tower
to tower, and wooden balconies across the transepts. (These look
like sixteenth century work; can they have been erected when the
transepts were cut back, perhaps at the Reformation?) By means
of a simple archway over a road the blindstorey also communicates
with the old Bishop's Palace to the eastward. The clearstorey
has no passage along its windows, but round the apse there is an
extra arcade between it and the blindstorey, which greatly improves
the effect.
</p>
<p class="pfn">
The quire and apse with the central space and one bay of the nave
are higher in floor-level than the rest of the church, and underneath
is a crypt whose vaulting rests on a row of square columns, and whose
small windows open to the aisles.
</p>
<p class="pfn">
Some of the fittings are extremely beautiful Renaissance work,
especially the reredos with folding wings. This, it is said, a Dutch
skipper was trying to smuggle through the Sound; on being detected
he placed on it a ludicrously low value, hoping that the duty might
thus be extremely light. Unfortunately, however, the Danish
authorities preferred to purchase the work at the figure that its too
clever owner had named. The worrying resourcefulness of customs
house officials is no new thing.</p></div>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> The earliest that exists was built in 1384 by Bishop Ulfeld, who
hallowed it to St. Laurence; the vaulting springs from little grotesque
heads, and there are some beautiful wall paintings. In fact,
many such have survived throughout the cathedral. Joining it
on the west is another little square chapel, erected 1464, hallowed to
St. Brita (p. <a href="#Page_195">195</a>). Here is some really beautiful old woodwork,
and one of the wall paintings shows us a green devil writing. Westward
it joins the north porch. Touching the south porch on the other
side of the nave is the large chapel to the Three Holy Kings, erected
1459-64. A much older granite shaft with details of Byzantine
character stands in the centre to support the vault which elsewhere
rests on ancient corbels. Foliage and figure paintings cover vault
and walls, and there are two sumptuous Classic Renaissance monuments
to Christian III. (1533-59) and Frederic II. (1559-88). The
former was chiefly responsible for the Danish Reformation, but
neither king has so large a place in history as the columned canopies
and numerous figures of their marble monuments might seem to
imply. On the north side of the church Christian IV. (p. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>) built a
fair chapel with star vaulting (whose character is indicated on the
plan), resembling that of one bay in the sacristy. It is an interesting
specimen of Gothic, dated 1615, the iron grill screen 1620, and the
light streams in through two large four-fold windows, whose tracery
is formed by the mullions intersecting, a common form in English
work of that day, which is found also in a few of the oldest churches
of Virginia. These are the only windows in the cathedral that
are not single lights except the double ones in the upper stages of the
western towers, which are later than the lower parts. The tall
taper spires, copper-sheathed and nearly round, were added by the
same king; they are a distinct improvement on those of the cathedral
at Lübeck, which they rather resemble, and an ornament to the
whole countryside.

<p class="pfn">
The great Chapel of Frederick V. (1746-66) is cross-shaped with a
huge dome rising above; there are pilasters against the walls, and
two columns (all with Ionic caps) separate it from the wide vestibule
which joins the church. It is lighted from high up, and is a very
fine thing in itself, though hopelessly out of keeping with the cathedral.
(It was built after the death of the king whose name it
bears, p. 135.)</p></div>

architecture in contempt of mediæval work. Evelyn in 1641 speaks
of "one of the fairest churches of the Gotiq design I had seene,"
at a time when "Gothic" was used much as we employ "Teutonic"
to-day. In 1713 Wren (<i>Parentalia</i>, a family biography by his son)
says, "This we now call the Gothick manner of architecture so the
Italians called what was not after the Roman style." The depreciatory
use of the term seems first to occur in Dryden, 1695: "All
that has not the ancient gust is called a barbarous or Gothique
manner." So that it seems quite possible that Gothic architecture
merely signified the style of the North of Europe as opposed to that
of the South. Mallet (<i>Northern Antiquities</i>, translated from <i>Introduction
à l'Histoire de Dannemarc</i>, 1770) refers to so many mediæval
"edifices wherein we can find nothing to admire but the inexhaustible
patience and infinite pains of those who built them!"</p></div>

on four round arches that rest on square columns, placed
close to the four corners. To the north and south and also to the
west there project very shallow arms the same height as the rest.
Over the western one and resting its corners on two of the large
columns, rises a great square tower, three two-light windows aside
in its upper stage. In the thickness of the walls there are stairs
and galleries on three levels, whence varying views of the interior
are gained. A comparatively low arch in the eastern wall opens to
a small chancel, rib-vaulted and extended by a horseshoe apse.
The details throughout are Romanesque of the plainest and the
best, but the inspiration is clearly Byzantine. On a small scale the
same sort of combination is attempted that La Farge has essayed in
the great Cathedral of St. John at New York.</p></div>

being close to the corners the columns were so spaced that the nine

chancel which has a square east end; buildings joined it north and
south; that on the latter side was evidently a transeptal chapel.

These square churches are extraordinarily interesting to the
student of architecture from the fact that they display Byzantine
forms exercising an influence on the development of Gothic in the

town churches at the present day, especially where the site is awkward

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_88_88" id="Footnote_88_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> It is a fine late Romanesque building, quite moderate in scale.
For five bays extend nave and aisles, and the square chancel is
flanked by small towers which become octagonal above the roof.
(These are a characteristic German feature, and recall Trier or
Mainz, but this Visby church has no resemblance to any existing
building in Lübeck.) Pillars of some variety with figure-and leaf-carved
caps sustain the triple vault, nor is the centre carried higher
than the aisles. The great south door, six times recessed with shafts
both round and square, is a magnificent example of what in England
is called Norman work. There are many such fine doorways in the
town, but no other is as good as this. Rather later than the rest
a great west tower was built, and on the northern side it has a gallery
open by a rich arcade.
</p>
<p class="pfn">
Extensive alterations and additions to the church were undertaken
when men first began to build large traceried windows; they
probably went on for long, but it may safely be assumed they were
in progress about the year 1300. Most beautiful windows with
foliated circles in their heads, not all alike, were pierced through the
elder walls. A fair chapel was added west of south, adorned with
pinnacles and gargoyles and statues and recessed carved door;
clustered shafts hold up its vault. The climate doubtless caused
it to open by a doorway, not arches, to the church. A tall addition
was raised over the church with blindstorey arches and trefoil lancets
in the clearstorey walls. It is a tempting hypothesis that it was
intended to break through the central vault and to double the height
of the nave, but C. Enlart is almost certainly right in saying: "These
lofty halls above Scandinavian churches are sometimes habitable.
The one which still rises over the nave of the church of St. Mary,
now the cathedral, at Visby, had a chimney. It was the seat of the
consulate of the Lübeck merchants, to whom the church belonged"
(<i>Revue de l'Art Chrétien</i>, Sept.-Oct., 1910). In the middle ages
churches served for the most miscellaneous purposes, and meetings
of all kinds were held in them. In much the same style two stages
were added to each of the eastern towers. In later days Renaissance
spires were added to all the three towers, the largest having a
balcony all round. A canopied pulpit was set up in the church,
which is dated 1684.</p></div>

clear, but the spacing of the pillars through the seven bays is exceedingly
irregular, and on the south by the ruined cloister is an older
chapel, the vault below quadripartite, above a tunnel. This church
was finally consecrated, it seems, only in 1412, and it is apparently
the only important mediæval building which is subsequent in date
to the raid of 1361. The tower stood at the west end till 1885,

and outer chapels, the western towers being the full width of both;
each transept is of two bays and aisleless, the apse is three-sided
with ambulatory and five radiating chapels, themselves apsidal.
The corresponding chapels of Notre Dame, no less than thirteen
in number, are not apsidal except the central one (though they
usually are in other great French Gothic churches), but they were
not built at the time Upsala was erected. In the case of Notre
Dame the nave has two more bays and the quire one more, while
the chapels, which were additions, are beyond the outer aisles.
The length of Notre Dame is 430 feet, that of Upsala 360 feet, while
across the transepts the French cathedral measures 165 feet, the
Swedish 135 feet. The building of Upsala Cathedral was not finished
till the fifteenth century, and the traceried windows in aisles and
clearstorey are rather poor. The arches of the nave chapels are
without caps, those of the quire in the same position are rather
elaborate, and there is some good carved work over doors and round
the ambulatory, though hardly in the same class with that at Notre
Dame. The church was largely rebuilt in 1885-93, when the tall
metal spires replaced rather ugly eighteenth century turrets and the
central flèche was built. Both inside and outside look very new.
The former is largely covered with modern paintings, and nearly
all the fittings are recent except the beautiful Renaissance canopied
pulpit by Tessin (p. <a href="#Page_203">203</a>).

<p class="pfn">
(I am unable to agree with Fergusson in thinking this "an extremely
uninteresting church." T. Francis Bumpus, in his beautiful
work, <i>The Cathedrals and Churches of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark</i>,
1908, comes to the conclusion that French influence in the design
was small, and that it is to be attributed to a Swedish architect
under very strong North German influence, but his reasons do not
seem very conclusive.)</p></div>

is extra-diocesan, forming a sort of "enclave" administered by the
Pastor Primarius and his consistory; necessary episcopal functions
are performed by the Archbishop of Upsala. The church, originally
about the same age as the Riddarsholmskyrka, was largely reconstructed
about 1736, the chancel being removed, and the outer
aisles apparently built. The square clock-tower has pilasters, the
church has Classic buttresses, cornices, etc., but there are some
mongrel-decorated windows. The interior is still largely mediæval,
and most impressive from the wide dimensions&mdash;eight bays and
five aisles all vaulted at the same level. The brick pillars are mostly
clustered, the central vault has most ornate brick ribs, and the aisle
roofs have remains of old paintings. There are really splendid
Renaissance fittings, including a lovely Augsburg carved wooden
reredos, stone font with Runic patterns dated 1514, two canopied

in the triumphant temperance movement, aided by the great chymist,
Berzelius, who has a statue in the little Stockholm park that bears
his name. Gustavus III. in 1775 had made distilling and selling
spirits a Government monopoly, yielding a chief item of revenue.
When this was abolished and distilling became absolutely free to
all the state of Sweden became much worse than before.

<p class="pfn">
Eventually drinking was reduced to its present very moderate
dimensions by confining the manufacture and sale of spirits to
companies which may make what profit they can on everything else,
but are only allowed five per cent. on drinks, any surplus being
handed over to the local authority for providing such things as
lectures, sports, excursions and libraries. As in America, districts
may vote to be entirely "dry" if they prefer. This arrangement,
generally called the Gotenburg system, with local variations, is in
force over most of Norway and Sweden. Göteborg adopted it in
1865, and Stockholm followed in 1877. Beer is outside the arrangement.</p></div>

Tressini, an Italian architect. It is a rather commonplace Classic
church whose details are extremely poor, though the interior has
a certain impressiveness from the tall pillars supporting the roof,
for the usual galleries are not there. Over the windows are cherubs.
Over the eastern octagon rises a little onion dome. The tower that
surmounts the western front is crowned by the gilded needle spire
which soars, out of all proportion to the church, no less than 364 feet
into the air, sometimes most impressively catching the light of the
setting sun while all is in shadow around.</p></div>

The other large monastery in St. Petersburg, Smolni, by the bend
in the river, has buildings surrounding two huge courts which are
made very pleasant by trees. The first, which is much the larger,
has a covered cloister all round and a high dome in each corner.
The centre of the western side is left open to expose to the street
the chief façade of the church, which, like the Chantry at Winchester,
stands detached in the centre of the court. It is a simple and
impressive Italian Renaissance building, 245 feet long, with pilasters
on two levels and in the centre a lofty tower, open to the top within.
The interior is all white, some marble shafts giving relief to the
eternal plaster. Designed by Rastrelli in 1734, the structure follows
the type of his native country, except that five great onion domes
mark as Russian the top of the tower. The faults of the building
are glaring enough, but Fergusson seems rather severe in his remark:
"It would be difficult to find in Europe anything so really bad as
this."</p></div>

pilasters on two levels, but the architrave bends over each of the
upper windows, and the consequent loss of the horizontal line that
is of the very essence of Classic architecture, is absolutely fatal to
the effect. Several halls and other chambers within are extremely
magnificent, but the most glorious columns of marble support
gilded capitals of plaster, and there is a good deal to justify
Fergusson's observation about a man of taste recoiling in horror
from such a piece of barbaric magnificence. The chapel is frankly
Russian with the customary onion dome. The figures of the eikonastasis
stand out detached, though the Eastern Church as a rule
holds anything more than very slight relief as a breach of the Second
Commandment. This little building contains some priceless relics,
hands of the Baptist and of the Virgin, a fragment of the body of St.
George, a piece of the true cross, a picture painted by St. Luke!
There are relics nearer our own day in the chamber where the second
Alexander died in 1881, after being wounded by the bomb (p. <a href="#Page_253">253</a>).
His empty study chair, the books as he left them on the table, the
few coins in his pocket when he went out for the last time, his
unfinished cigarette, his coat thrown over the back of a chair, the
couch on which he passed away.</p></div>

Leo von Klenze, of Munich, and it was erected about the middle
of the nineteenth century. There are two large courts, but one of
them is divided by the great staircase which rises between two rows
of magnificent grey marble columns that support the plaster ceiling;
other portions have a very rich effect from the profusion of coloured
marbles and the beautiful inlaid wood flowers which almost give
the impression of mosaic. The lower storey forms a very complete
museum, beginning with ancient Egypt and including many interesting
things from different parts of the Russian Empire. The upper
storey, which is higher and much better lighted, houses the famous
collection of pictures.</p></div>

granite, 56 feet high (bases and Corinthian caps of bronze), to support
the sculptured tympanum, whose figures are in high relief, and is
approached by a stately flight of steps. Except on the east there
are splendid portals with grape patterns in stone and beautiful relief
bronze doors. The side porticoes are deeper than the others and
flanked by turrets for bells. The plan of the church is a simple
oblong, 305 by 166 feet. Only four great windows admit light to the
interior (except for a single one behind the altar opening into the
eastern portico and those of the lantern dome), one on each side of
the lateral porticoes. These naturally dwarf the design very much.
A rather poorly planned circular colonnade and iron dome rise
through the roof, resting on four huge piers in the church. The
arrangement of the vaulting is made to suggest the ordinary cruciform
plan, with a dome in each corner. The general effect is extremely
rich from the magnificent shafts of malachite and lapis
lazuli, and the lavish decorations of inlaid marble and mosaic, but
nothing can redeem the poverty and commonplace character of
the design. Fergusson calls the building a cold and unsatisfactory
failure, and says there is not a week's thought in the whole design
from pavement to dome cross. This it is not easy to deny, but
there is much to redeem the failure, particularly in the splendour
of the material.

The other Renaissance buildings of the city are very numerous,
and in many cases very large, but for variety they cannot be said
to be remarkable. Of the foreign architects successively employed,
not one was really good, and decidedly the best buildings on the
whole are those designed by Russians who had mastered the principles
of the foreign style. One of the most successful, by Varonikin,
was erected at the worst possible period&mdash;the early nineteenth
century. It is the Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan, an Italian
building, 257 feet long. Inviting colonnades extend from the north
transept to the street, forming a vast semi-circle and suggesting the
piazza of St. Peter's. The portico of the transept appears in the
centre with the dome rising above, and, material apart, this is one
of the most successful things of its kind ever built. Nave and south
transept also have porticoes. The columns throughout the building
are in pairs, and within the effect is most striking from the granite
columns that uphold the great entablature, the lofty flat roofs of the
aisles, and the way in which the lantern rises from arches which
terminate the tunnel vaults of the four arms. Much of the eikonastasis
is of silver, and the floor is marble inlaid.</p></div>

in the right place by making the metal almost solid at the
back and quite thin in front. In November, 1770, Rev. J. C. King

Falconet's statue is to be placed.... It is ... arrived at
St. Petersburg: the Empress had earrings made of it for herself."</p></div>

the west tower, and the three eastern apses. Some are covered
with extraordinary raised glazed tiles, the central one greatly resembling
a turban. The interior is both simpler and better than the
outside; four columns with round arches sustain the central lantern,
and round arches open to apses and tower. The floor is of marble
inlaid; walls, piers and vaults are covered with the most beautiful
mosaics in prevailing colours of blue and gold, saints in four tiers
varied by landscapes and lilies. The old church furniture displayed
in the Museum of Alexander III. seems to show Byzantine forms
getting more and more modified by increasing Tatar influences.
In the same place are some very interesting paintings by Russian
artists. Verestchagin has the place of honour, and is represented
by some excellent pictures of battle scenes, some displaying the
French at Moscow. The picture of Abram and Isaac done by Reutern
with his left hand has faces that could hardly be better.</p></div>
